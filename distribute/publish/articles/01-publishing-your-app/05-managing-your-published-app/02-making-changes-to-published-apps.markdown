# Making Changes to Published Apps [](id=making-changes-to-published-apps)

You can make these kinds of changes during the life of your published app:

- Edit your app details (e.g., description, icon, etc.)
- Add new license bundles (quantities)
- Edit app prices of bundles
- Modify regional availability
- Add support for a new version of Liferay
- Release a new version of your app to fix bugs or offer new functionality
- Disable your app

Your currently approved app remains available while you're submitting changes
and while Liferay reviews and tests your app changes. 

The rest of this article describes each kind of change. 

## Editing Your App's Metadata [](id=editing-your-app-details)

App metadata includes the name, description, icon, screenshots, and other
information you supplied during the app creation process. To make changes
to this content for your app, navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Apps* and
select the app you wish to edit. Click the *Edit* button to edit that app. 

This screen shows you what the app looks like on Marketplace. To edit the detail
information, click the *Edit* button at the bottom of the preview. Now you can
edit details and add new files to your existing version. The current values as
they appear in your app pre-populate the form. Make any changes as needed on
this screen and click *Next*. If you don't need to edit any more variations,
you can continue clicking *Next* until you reach the final preview screen. Click
*Submit for Review* to submit your changes for review. All changes must go
through the submission process. If your app revision only consists of metadata
changes, it need only go through the 
[*App metadata review*](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/understanding-the-app-review-process)
phase of the review process. 

Once approved, the changes you request appear for your app on the Marketplace.

## Editing App Prices [](id=editing-app-prices)

You can change your app's prices, add or remove bundles, and modify regional
availability for a variety of reasons, whether it's to run a promotional offer,
or to adjust your pricing model to better account for app demand. To make
changes to your app, navigate to *Company Profile Home* &rarr; *Apps*, then
click the app you wish to edit, and then at the bottom, click *Edit* &rarr;
*Pricing*. When you've finished editing your app's prices, click *Next*. 

These changes do not require Liferay verification process to approve. Make the
changes you wish and save your app. The new prices show immediately. 

You cannot however, modify the following attributes of an approved app: 

- Free vs. paid
- License term (perpetual vs. non-perpetual)
- Support subscription offering (cannot be removed)

Next, you can consider adding support for new versions of Liferay. 

## Adding Support for New Versions of Liferay [](id=adding-support-for-new-versions-of-liferay-portal)

If you must add files to support another Liferay release, the process is
similar. Navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Apps* and select the app you wish to
edit. Click the *Edit* button to edit that app. Click *Next* to advance past the
details screen (making any changes as needed), and click *Next* to advance past
the version edit screen (you can't actually edit the version number of an
already-approved version, but you can edit the "What's New" information).

Once you advance past the version edit screen, the File Upload screen appears.
This screen should look familiar---it's the same workflow used when you
initially created your app! The difference is that you can't edit pre-approved
files for specific Liferay releases. You can only add *new* files for
a different Liferay release (if you must update existing files, you must create
a new version of the app---see the later section on adding versions for details
on how to do this).

Upload your new files (ensuring that your new plugins have updated compatibility
information: see the
[Marketplace App Metadata Guidelines](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/preparing-your-app)
for details on versions), click *Next*, and observe the newly-added files listed
at the bottom of the preview screen. Click *Submit for Review* to submit your
requested change (adding files). Liferay reviews the files, and once approved,
the new package becomes available for download in the Marketplace.

## Releasing a New Version of your App [](id=releasing-a-new-version-of-your-app)

As time passes, you may wish to add new functionality to your app or fix a batch
of bugs. This can be accomplished by releasing a new version of your app. New
versions offer your users new functionality and bug fixes, and users are
generally encouraged to use the latest version. In addition, when a new version
of your app becomes available, Marketplace notifies existing users. 

New versions of your apps are created in a similar fashion to creating new apps.
To add a new version, navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Apps* and select the
app you wish to edit. Click the *Edit* button to edit that app. The Details
screen appears. At the bottom of the Details screen, click the *Add New Version*
button. This button begins the process of adding a new version, starting with
the App Details screen. In this case, data from the current version of the app
pre-populates the screen. 

You can modify the screen's pre-populated data. Since this is a new version of
an existing app, making major changes (such as completely changing the name or
description) might unsettle existing users. Uploading new screenshots and
refreshing app icons is common. Note that you cannot change the app owner (such
as moving from a personally-developed app to a company-developed app).

Clicking *Next* takes you through the same screens you've already seen. On the
*Add App Version* screen, you can specify a new version name for this version of
your app. Also, note that when adding new versions to an existing app, you can
add *What's New* text. This typically lists changes for this version, such as
significant new features or bug fix information. Clicking *Next* from here lets
you upload the files associated with the new version of the app. For a new
version of the app, you must upload all files for all supported Liferay versions
again, even if they have not changed since the last version.

## Deactivating Your App [](id=deactivating-your-app)

When the time comes to retire your app, you can *Deactivate* it. Deactivating an
app makes it unavailable to new customers, and it doesn't appear in any public
Marketplace listings. Existing customers that have already downloaded your app
can continue downloading the legacy versions of the app they have already
acquired, but they can't download any versions they've not already received. The
app remains in your inventory, with all of its history, in case you choose to
re-activate or reference it.

To deactivate your app, navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Apps* and select the
app you wish to deactivate. Click the *Deactivate* button.

In this set of articles, we looked at how to create, publish, maintain, and
track Liferay Marketplace apps. You can do this through the App Manager that's
available on your *Account Home* page on [liferay.com](http://liferay.com)
(liferay.com) account required!). We covered requirements for publishing
variations of your apps for different versions of Liferay. Next, we showed how
you can publish an app on the Marketplace and how you can modify the app as it
evolves. Finally, we looked at tracking app adoption using view, download, and
install metrics.
