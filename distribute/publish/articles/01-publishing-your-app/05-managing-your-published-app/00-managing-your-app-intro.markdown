# Managing Your Published App [](id=managing-your-published-app)

You've launched your new app on the Marketplace. Congratulations! As you settle
down from your launch celebration, you might wonder how your app is performing
in the Marketplace. Is there a way to monitor how many people are viewing it and
downloading it? And what about those features that didn't make this release? How
difficult will it be to upload your app's next version with those features?
Don't sweat it. The Liferay Marketplace and app wizard are here to help. 

You can track app performance. Marketplace shows app trends like views,
downloads, and purchases. The app wizard lets you upload new versions of
your app and it lets you make changes to some of its details. This demonstrates
how all of this works.
