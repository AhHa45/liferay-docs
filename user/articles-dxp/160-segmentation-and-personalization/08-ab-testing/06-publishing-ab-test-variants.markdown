# Publishing A/B Test Variants

[TOC levels=1-4]

Once the A/B test has concluded and Analytics Cloud has computed the test
results, the status for the test displays as *Winner Declared* (if a winning
Variant was found) or *No Winner* in @product@'s A/B Test sidebar panel. You're
also alerted to the result via a notification which you can view from the User
Menu.

| **Note:** When the required confidence level is not met during the set time
| duration, there is no winning Variant.

You can turn off these notifications in the notification configuration for A/B
Test.
