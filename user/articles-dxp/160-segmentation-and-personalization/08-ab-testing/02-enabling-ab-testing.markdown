# Enabling A/B Testing

[TOC levels=1-4]

Before creating an AB test, you must ensure some conditions are met:

- You must have @product@ connected to
  [Analytics Cloud](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006608732). To
  begin,
  [add a Data Source](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006653472-Adding-a-Liferay-DXP-Data-Source).

- Your page must be a Content Page, since only Content Pages (not Widget Pages)
  can be mapped to a Segment.

- The Content Page you intend to test must be published.

If these conditions are met, AB Testing is automatically enabled for any
Content Page you navigate to, assuming you have the proper permissions. You'll
learn more about how to assign permissions for AB Testing next.
