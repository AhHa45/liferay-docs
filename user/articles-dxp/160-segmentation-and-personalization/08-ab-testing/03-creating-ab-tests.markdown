# Creating A/B Tests

[TOC levels=1-4]

- The option to create an AB test will only be available when viewing a Content
  Page, since only Content pages, not widget pages, can be mapped to a segment.


- There needs to be sufficient traffic on the page (ideally 1000 views/day).
  Having low traffic on the page will extend the duration of the test run.

The marketer makes necessary changes, previews the changes and may select to
proceed in ways including, but not limited to:

- Start/Run Test: The system then starts the test and should start capturing
  user activity on the page.
- Schedule; The marketing analyst can choose to schedule a time and date when
  the test should start.
- Save as Draft; The system saves the test as draft but does not start the test.
- Cancel; The system exits the AB Test creation and does not save
user input. No changes will be made to the page/experience.

- A test can be performed on the Default Experience as well as an experience
  mapped to a segment

- Page visitors that fit the targeted segment will randomly be split among
  control and page variants.

- The duration of a test run is estimated based on page traffic. To change the
  test duration, the marketing analyst can change the confidence level.

A user cannot create a test on an experience when there is an active test
running for the same experience.

Assets like Documents, Blogs, etc can be used as variables in a test since the
metrics tracked will be independent of the assetâ€™s content. Editing the assets
should not affect the AB Test.

Page visitors should always see the same experience every time he visits a page;
ie, when an AB Test is running and a page visitor first navigates to a page and
sees the control page, he should always see the control page every time he
navigates to it, not control page on first visit, variant on 2nd, control on
3rd, etc.
