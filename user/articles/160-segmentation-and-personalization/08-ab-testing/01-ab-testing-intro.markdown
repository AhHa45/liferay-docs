One of the most important objectives for any team is providing the right
experience for their audience. To help shape your idea of the customer's needs,
you should periodically test your site's effectiveness by displaying a different
UX and messaging scheme. This lets you form a hypothesis about your audience and
test it to confirm or disprove it. Likewise, you should be cautious about how
much your process changes impact customers' current workflow on your site. You
should provide a solution that easily fits into their existing workflow while
adding as little overhead as possible.

This can be done using *A/B Testing*. This lets you maintain a page's current
UX and messaging, but provide an alternative setup for a control group of
visitors. Then you can evaluate the experience analytics between the two
page variations and decide which process is more effective.

For example, consider a Marketing team for a dog food company provides a Content
Page advertising their newest dog treat. The page has been published for a few
weeks, but they think a redesign could help promote the new product better. With
A/B Testing, they can create a new page variation and display both pages at
random to visitors. Then they can analyze the clickthrough rate for the two
pages and find which page is more effective. If the prototype page is more
effective, they can publish it and remove the old page.

Some A/B Testing features include

- Integration with Content Pages
- Segment-specific testing
- Easy ways to check statistical significance without being a data analyst
