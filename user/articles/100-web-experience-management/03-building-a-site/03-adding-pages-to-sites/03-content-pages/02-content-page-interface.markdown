# Content Page Management Interface

[TOC levels=1-4]

Unlike Widget Pages, Content Pages can only be edited through the *Site 
Builder* and cannot be edited live on the page. Any edits that you make to a 
page are saved as a draft until you publish the page. Subsequent changes 
after the initial publication are again saved as a draft, without affecting the 
live page, until the page is published again. To create a Content Page,

1.  Go to *Site Management* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click ![Add](../../../../../images/icon-add.png).

3.  On the next page, select *Content Page* and provide a name for the page.

    You will be brought to the Content Page management interface.
    
    ![Figure 1: Each Content Page starts as a blank page.](../../../../../images/content-page-edit-blank-page.png)

To edit an existing Content Page,

1.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click *Actions* (![Actions](../../../../../images/icon-staging-bar-options.png))
    &rarr; *Edit* next to the Content Page you want to edit.

You can also get to this page by selecting the *Edit* button
(![Edit](../../../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) from the Control Menu if
you're viewing the published Content Page.

On this page you can view a preview of your page, add Fragments and Widgets, 
and manage the configuration for the page or any Fragments and Widgets 
currently residing on the page.

Your tools for building the page are all found on the right side of the page. 
From top to bottom, the options are

- [Sections](#sections)
- [Section Builder](#section-builder)
- [Widgets](#widgets)
- [Page Structure](#page-structure)
- [Look and Feel](#look-and-feel)

### Sections

When you open *Sections* you see a list of Collections available. Initially, 
you only have the **Basic Sections** Collection which is included with the 
product. You can open the Collection and drag Sections directly onto the page.

![Figure 2: *Sections* contains Fragments that fully define spaces on your page.](../../../../../images/content-page-sections-editor.png)

Once a section is added to a page, you can edit its background color,
background image, and spacing. Since these options are available to marketers
and administrators editing a page, the options are limited, and the color
palette can be set by the Fragment developer.

![Figure 3: The Section managment tool provide powerful tools, but with the training wheels still on.](../../../../../images/content-page-sections-config.png)

### Section Builder

In Section Builder, you start with *Layouts* and *Basic Components*. Add 
Layouts to the page to provide a spaces where you can add Components.

![Figure 4: *Sections Builder* contains *Component* Fragments which are intended to be combined to create Sections.](../../../../../images/content-page-section-builder-editor.png)

### Widgets

The Widgets section functions just like the *Add* menu on a Widget Page. The 
full list of available widgets is displayed, and you can add them to the page.

![Figure 5: The Widgets section provides a list of Widgets that can be added inside of a Layout.](../../../../../images/content-page-widget-editor.png)

The main difference is that only the main configuration options for widgets on 
Content Pages. Various other configurations like *Look and Feel* are only 
available for widgets on Widget Pages.

### Page Structure

Page Structure provides a high level view of every Fragment and every field
within each Fragment on the page.

![Figure 6: *Page Structure* shows you a hierarchy of your page.](../../../../../images/content-page-page-structure-editor.png)

Clicking on a field in Page Structure will  highlight it on the page. On large
complicated page, this helps you keep on top  of where everything is and also
access items that might be hard to click on  directly.

### Look and Feel

The last icon on the right side of the page will bring you to the *Look and 
Feel* configuration for the page where you can change the theme or manage other 
options for the page. These options are fully documented in the
[Page Management](docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/user/creating-pages) section.

### The Title Bar

The title bar provides navigation back to the Main Menu, a link to page
configuration, and the ability to search for other pages. The title bar is
covered in more detail in the
[Page Management](docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-pages) section.

Great! Now you know how to use the content page interface!
