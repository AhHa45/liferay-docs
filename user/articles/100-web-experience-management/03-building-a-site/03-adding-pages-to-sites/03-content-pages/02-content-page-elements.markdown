# Content Page Elements

[TOC levels=1-4]

Content Pages, like Widget Pages, are built by dragging and dropping elements on
to the page, and then configuring the way those elements display. There are
several types of elements that you can add to the page.

**Sections** are fragments that define a space to work in. A section fills 
the entire width of the page. Sections can be thought of as *complete*
Fragments which serve a purpose by themselves. A large banner image with a text 
overlay is an example of something you might build as a section.

**Layouts** are special Sections that define spaces where you can add fragments
or widgets. Each layout you add fills the width of the page. You can add  any
number of layouts to the page.

**Components** are small design elements or pieces which add some functionality 
to the page. A component might be an image with specific formatting or a block 
of text with specific styling pre-applied. Components must be added to the page 
inside of a Layout. If you add a component outside of an existing Layout, a one 
column layout is automatically added with the Component to contain it. 
While Sections should be complete in and of themselves, Components are intended 
to work together to build something piece by piece.

Out of the box, you are provided with a plethora of Layouts, Sections, and 
Components to use to build pages, and a
[web developer can create their own Fragments](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/creating-fragments)
to add to these. 

## Editable Elements

Fragments can be 100% static, or they can have editable elements. After a 
Fragment has been added to a page, you can click on an editable area to provide 
your own text, image, or links in place of the default defined in the Fragment.

### Editable Text

Editable text can be plain text or rich text. Plain text can only be simple 
text with no special styling. Rich text provides a number of editing and 
formatting options including different text styles, typographical emphasis, 
alignment, and list formatting.

### Editable Images

For an editable image element, you can replace the image with a URL or with an 
image from your Documents and Media library. You can provide a link target for 
the image.

Next you'll learn about the Content Page Editing Interface.
