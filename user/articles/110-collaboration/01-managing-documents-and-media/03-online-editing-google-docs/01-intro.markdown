[add](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-2/adding-files-to-a-document-library#using-the-add-menu) 
and 
[edit](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-2/checking-out-and-editing-files) 
Documents and Media files via upload and download, @product@ doesn't contain a 
UI that lets you author or edit documents directly inside the portal. You can, 
however, create and edit Documents and Media files online in Google Docs&trade;, 
Google Sheets&trade;, and Google Slides&trade;. The articles in this section 
explain how.

**Note:** For simplicity and readability, this documentation refers only to 
Google Docs&trade;. The material, however, also applies to Google Sheets&trade; 
and Google Slides&trade;.

Note that when you use Google Docs&trade; to create or edit a Documents and 
Media file, that file isn't permanently stored in Google Docs&trade;. Google 
Docs&trade; is only used for its editing UI. Your edits are then saved to the 
Documents and Media Library.
