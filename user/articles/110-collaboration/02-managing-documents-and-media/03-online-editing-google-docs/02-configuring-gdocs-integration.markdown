# Configuring Google Docsâ„¢ Integration

Before you can use Google Docs&trade; to create and edit Documents and Media 
files, you must configure @product@ to connect with an application in the 
[Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com). 
Here, you'll learn how. 

## Configure Your Google Project

First, you must configure your Google project to use the Google Drive&trade; 
API, and set up OAuth 2 for use with that project. Follow these steps to do so: 

1.  Go to the
    [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com). 
    If you don't have a suitable project, 
    [create a new one](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6251787?hl=en&ref_topic=7014522). 

2.  Enable the Google Drive&trade; API for your project. For instructions, see 
    the Google API Console documentation on 
    [enabling and disabling APIs](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841). 

3.  Create an OAuth 2 client ID for your Google project. For instructions, see 
    the Google API Console documentation on 
    [setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849). 
    Select *Web application* when prompted to select your application type. Take 
    note of the client ID and client secret that appear---you'll need them to 
    configure the portal to use the Google Drive&trade; API. 

## Configuring the Portal

Now that you have a Google project set up for use with @product@, you must 
configure the portal to connect with that project. You can do this at two 
levels: 

1.  Globally, for all instances in your @product@ installation.
2.  At the instance level, for one or more instances in your @product@ 
    installation. 

You can override the global configuration for one or more instances by 
configuring those instances separately. Similarly, you can configure only the 
instances you want to connect to your Google project, and leave the global 
configuration empty. 

## Global Configuration
 
Follow these steps to configure all instances in your @product@ installation to 
use the same settings to connect to your Google project: 

1.  Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; 
    *Documents and Media*. 

2.  Under *VIRTUAL INSTANCE SCOPE*, select *Google Drive*. 

3.  Enter your Google project's OAuth 2 client ID and client secret into the 
    *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields. 

4.  Click *Save*.

| **Note:** You can ignore the *Picker API Key* field. This field is unrelated 
| to the Google Docs&trade; online editing features in @product@.

## Instance Configuration

Follow these steps to configure an individual instance to connect to your Google 
project: 

1.  Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings* 
    &rarr; *Documents and Media*. 
<!-- Merge with previous section -->


That's it! Now your users can create and edit Documents and Media files online 
via Google Docs&trade;. Note that if you want to disable this feature, you can 
delete the client ID and client secret values from the form in the last step.
