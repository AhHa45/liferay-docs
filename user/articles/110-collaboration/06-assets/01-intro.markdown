# Assets

When you think of assets, you probably think of things like houses, cars, money, 
or gold bricks. Although @product@ is capable of holding many assets, we're not 
talking about financial assets. Assets in @product@ are any kind of content. For 
example, images, documents, and web content are all assets. And although such 
assets may not have the tangible value of a gold brick, they could equal or even 
exceed that value when used to support an organization's day-to-day business 
activities. You might even think of @product@ as your very own Fort Knox (don't 
worry, we won't tell anyone).
