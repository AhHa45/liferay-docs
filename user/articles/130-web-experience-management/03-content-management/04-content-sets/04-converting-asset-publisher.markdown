# Converting Asset Publisher Configurations to Content Sets

In the previous two guides in this section, you've seen [Creating Content Sets](user-guide-link) and [Displaying Content Sets](user-guide-link) 
demonstrated. Next, try out converting an existing Asset Publisher 
configuration to a Content Set.

In this case, you have an Asset Publisher on a page, which is configured to 
display images tagged as *trending* in reverse alphabetical order by title. 
This might not be too hard to reproduce in the *Content Set* creator, but it's 
even easier to create the Content Set definition directly from the Asset 
Publisher.

1.  Go to ![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Configuration* for 
    the Asset Publisher.
    
2.  Click *Create a content set from this configuration*.

![Figure 1: You can generate a Content Set directly from the Asset Publisher configuration.](../../../../images/content-set-create-ap.png)

3.  Enter the title and click *Save*.

And as quickly as that you have a new Content Set that you can use with Asset
Publishers anywhere on the site.
