# Change Lists

Change Lists provide a way to track assets and how they're displayed system
wide. You can group changes into working *sets* and publish them when they're
ready. This prevents users from seeing changes that aren't ready for production;
you can manage a change list and provide edits to your site in the background
and push to the live environment when they're ready for your audience.

A change list is not tied to a specific site. This means that you can track
multi-site environments with a single change list.

Change lists support two major changes:

- Asset addition, edit, or deletion
- Asset display (e.g., page, layouts, widget preferences)

| **Note:** Change lists support for pages and layouts are still in development
| and not available for @product@ 7.2 GA1.

The following content types are supported by change lists at this time:

- Web Content
- DDM Template
- DDM Structure
