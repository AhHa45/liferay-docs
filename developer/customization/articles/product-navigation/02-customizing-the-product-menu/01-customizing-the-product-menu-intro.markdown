# Customizing the Product Menu

[TOC levels=1-4]

By default, Liferay's Product Menu consists of two main sections: Control Panel
and Site Administration. These sections are called panel categories. For
instance, the Control Panel is a single panel category, and when clicking on it,
you see six child panel categories: *Users*, *Sites*, *Apps*, *Configuration*,
*Workflow*, and *Change Lists*. Clicking a child panel category shows panel
apps.

| **Note:** The Product Menu cannot be changed by applying a new theme. To change
| the layout/style of the Product Menu, you must create and deploy a theme
| contributor. See the
| [Theme Contributors](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/packaging-independent-ui-resources-for-your-site)
| tutorial for more details.

The Product Menu is intuitive and easy to use---but you can still change it any
way you want. You can reorganize the panel categories and apps, or add
completely new categories and populate them with custom panel apps. Here you'll
learn how to provide new or modified panel categories and panel apps for the
Product Menu.
