# Product Navigation

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product@'s product navigation consists of the main menus you use to customize,
configure, and navigate the system. When you edit a page, switch to a different
Site scope, access a User's credentials, etc., you're using the default
navigation menus. Providing a customization to a default menu can help give your
Liferay instance a unique touch. You can extend and customize the default
product navigation to fit your need.

There are four product navigation sections that you can extend:

- Product Menu
- Control Menu
- Simulation Menu
- User Personal Menu.

The Product Menu is on the left, and displays the Control Panel, and Site
Administration functionality. The Control Menu is on top, offering navigation to
the Product Menu, Simulation Menu (the right menu), and the *Add* button. When
certain settings are enabled (e.g., Staging, Page Customization, etc.), more
tools are offered. The Simulation Menu offers options to simulate your Site's
look for different scenarios (devices, user segments, etc.). Finally, the User
Personal Menu holds selectable items containing a user's own account settings.

You'll learn more about each of these product navigation sections next.

## Product Menu

By default, Liferay's Product Menu consists of two main sections: Control Panel
and Site Administration. These sections are called *panel categories*. For
instance, the Control Panel is a single panel category, and when clicking on it,
you see six child panel categories: *Users*, *Sites*, *Apps*, *Configuration*,
*Workflow*, and *Change Lists*. Clicking a child panel category shows *panel
apps*.

The Product Menu is intuitive and easy to use---but you can still change it any
way you want. You can reorganize the panel categories and apps, or add
completely new categories and populate them with custom panel apps. You'll
learn how to provide new or modified panel categories and panel apps for the
Product Menu. For more information, read the
[Customizing the Product Menu](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/customizing-the-product-menu)
articles.

## Control Menu

The Control Menu is the most visible and accessible menu. For example, on your 
home page, the Control Menu offers default options for accessing the Product
Menu, Simulation Menu, and Add Menu. You can think of this menu as the gateway
to configuring options in @product@.

![Figure 1: The Control Menu has three configurable areas: left, right, and middle. It also displays the title and type of page that you are currently viewing.](../../../images/control-menu-home.png)

If you navigate away from the home page, the Control Menu adapts and provides
helpful functionality for whatever option you're using. For example, if you
navigate to Site Administration &rarr; *Content & Data* &rarr; *Web Content*,
you see a Control Menu with different functionality tailored for that option.

The default Control Menu contains three categories representing the left,
middle, and right portions of the menu. You can create navigation entries for
each category. For more information, read the
[Customizing the Control Menu](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/customizing-the-control-menu)
articles.
