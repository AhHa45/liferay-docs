# Liferay Customization

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product@ offers many built-in widgets and features for designing and creating
sites, pages, and content. On top of all this, it's highly customizable.
@product@'s modular architecture comprises components you can extend and
override dynamically. Additionally, within @product@, Fragments, Application
Display Templates, and advanced Web Experience Management provide ways to
develop templates and arrange content. In short, you can customize @product@ to
create user experiences you want fast. This section explains @product@'s
architecture and customization fundamentals, and demonstrates overriding and
extending @product@ components and applications using APIs. 

-   [Fundamentals](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/fundamentals)
    include understanding and configuring dependencies, packaging, and
    deployment. Here you'll work with module JARs, plugin WARs, components, and
    Java packages in @product@. 
 
-   [Architecture](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/architecture)
    dives deep into how @product@ uses modularity and OSGi to provide the core,
    application modules, component services, and extension points. Learning the
    architecture helps you develop better customizations fast and it empowers
    you to build extension points into your own applications.

-   [Built-in Customization Features](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/built-in-customization-features)
    shows you how to create pages and content faster using Fragments,
    Application Display Templates (ADTs), and Web Experience Management
    features. All this is done from within the @product@ UI.  

-   [Customizing Components](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/customizing-components)
    demonstrates overriding and extending @product@ UI components, services,
    language keys, LPKG files, and more. 

-   [Customizing Applications](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/customizing-applications)
    demonstrates modifying Liferay applications via their APIs and extension
    points.
