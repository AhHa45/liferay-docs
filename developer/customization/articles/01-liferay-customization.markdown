# Liferay Customization

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product@ offers many built in widgets and features for designing and creating
sites, pages, and content. On top of all this, it's highly customizable.
@product@'s modular architecture comprises components you can extend and
override dynamically. Additionally, within @product@, content can be developed
and arranged using Fragments, Application Display Templates, and advanced Web
Experience Management. In short, you can customize @product@ and develop
templates to create user experiences you want fast. This section explains
@product@'s architecture and customization fundamentals, and demonstrates
overriding and extending @product@ using its API. 

-   [OSGi fundamentals](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/osgi-fundamentals)
    include finding extension points, configuring dependencies, and deploying
    customizations. Here you'll work with modules, components, and Java packages
    to develop customizations. 
 
-   [Architecture](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/architecture)
    dives deep into how @product@ uses modularity and OSGi to provide the core,
    application modules, component services, and extension points. Learning the
    architecture helps you develop better customizations fast and it empowers
    you to build extension points into your own applications. 

-   [Overrides](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/overrides)
    demonstrates replacing and extending @product@ UI components, services,
    language keys, LPKG files, and more. 

-   [Templates](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/customization/templates)
    shows you how to create pages and content faster using Fragments,
    Application Display Templates (ADTs), and Web Experience Management
    features. All this is done from within the @product@ UI. 

Start with the fundamentals.
