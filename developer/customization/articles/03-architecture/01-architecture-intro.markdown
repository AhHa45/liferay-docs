# Architecture 

What's the Architecture look like?

What are the essentials of Liferay (its core)? What are optional?

How are the classes loaded?

Since @product@'s architecture is modular, it's important to understand modules, their benefits, and how modules work. 

Modules comprise components. They're TODO. Your modules (and your WARs) can consume component services. You can publish services from modules and CDI beans. 

So where do applications fit in? How do you deploy applications and make them available to @product@ users? How do applications use services, both local component services and remote web services? 

How do you customize @product@ and apps deployed on @product@?

What are Liferay's UI concepts? What UI standards can I use in @product@? How does @product@'s architecture facilitate UI development?
