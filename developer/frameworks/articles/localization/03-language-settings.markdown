# Using Liferay's Language Settings

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can customize a given locale's default language settings by 
[overriding language keys](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/overriding-language-keys) 
for the properties that control those settings. 

Modifying language key values provides a lot of localization flexibility in
itself, but we're always looking for new ways to give you more control. There
are language settings in `Language_xx.properties` files that give you even more
localization options. Consider these examples: 

-   In the add and edit user forms, you can configure the name fields that are 
    displayed and the field values available in select fields. For example, 
    leave out the middle name field if you want, or alter the prefix selections. 

-   You can also control the directionality of content and messages (left to 
    right or right to left). 

To see how these settings are configured, open the core `Language.properties` 
file in one of two ways: 

1.  From Liferay Portal's source code. Navigate to 

        liferay-portal/portal-impl/src/content/Language.properties

2. From a bundle's `portal-impl.jar`.

        [Liferay Home]/tomcat-[version]/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/portal-impl.jar

    Just open the `content` folder in the JAR to find the language files.

The first section in the `Language.properties` file is labeled *Language 
Settings*: 

```properties
##
## Language Settings
##

lang.dir=ltr
lang.line.begin=left
lang.line.end=right
lang.user.default.portrait=initials
lang.user.initials.field.names=first-name,last-name
lang.user.name.field.names=prefix,first-name,middle-name,last-name,suffix
lang.user.name.prefix.values=Dr,Mr,Ms,Mrs
lang.user.name.required.field.names=last-name
lang.user.name.suffix.values=II,III,IV,Jr,Phd,Sr
```

| **Note:** To use the language settings mentioned here, you need a module, 
| which is like a magic carpet on which your code and resources ride 
| triumphantly into @product@'s OSGi runtime. See the articles on 
| [overriding language keys](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/overriding-language-keys)
| to set up a module with the following characteristics:
| 
| -  Contains an implementation of `ResourceBundle` that is registered in the
|    OSGi runtime. 
| 
| -  Contains a `Language.properties` file for the locale whose properties you
|    want to override. 

## Localizing User Names

Naming conventions can differ between locales. For example, users in some 
locales have more than one last name. You can therefore change the user name 
properties to fit the needs of a given locale. The properties for changing user 
name settings begin with `lang.user.name` in the language settings section of a 
locale's language properties file. For most of the
[locales enabled by default](@platform-ref@/7.2-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Languages%20and%20Time%20Zones),
the user name properties are specifically tailored to that location. The default 
locales are specified by the `locales.enabled` property:

```properties
locales.enabled=ar_SA,ca_ES,zh_CN,nl_NL,en_US,fi_FI,fr_FR,de_DE,hu_HU,ja_JP,pt_BR,es_ES,sv_SE
```

For example, here are the English (`Language_en.properties`) properties for 
setting user name fields:

    lang.user.name.field.names=prefix,first-name,middle-name,last-name,suffix
    lang.user.name.prefix.values=Dr,Mr,Ms,Mrs
    lang.user.name.required.field.names=last-name
    lang.user.name.suffix.values=II,III,IV,Jr,Phd,Sr

![Figure 1: The user name settings impact the way user information and forms appear in Liferay.](../../images/english-user-name-fields.png)

Compare those to the Spanish (`Language_es.properties`) settings:

    lang.user.name.field.names=prefix,first-name,last-name
    lang.user.name.prefix.values=Sr,Sra,Sta,Dr,Dra
    lang.user.name.required.field.names=last-name

![Figure 2: The Spanish user name settings omit the suffix and middle name fields entirely.](../../images/spanish-user-name-fields.png)

The biggest difference between the English and Spanish form fields is that the
middle name and suffix fields are omitted in the Spanish configuration. Other
differences include the specific prefix values.



Customers come from all over the world, so naming conventions are different
between locales. Because of this, user name fields are configurable in the
following ways:

-   Remove certain name fields and make others appear more than once. Some
    locales need more than one last name, for example.

    ```properties
    lang.user.name.field.names=prefix,first-name,middle-name,last-name,suffix
    ```

-   Change the prefix and suffix values for a locale.

    ```properties
    lang.user.name.prefix.values=Dr,Mr,Ms,Mrs
    lang.user.name.suffix.values=II,III,IV,Jr,Phd,Sr
    ```

-  Specify which fields are required.

        lang.user.name.required.field.names=last-name

| **Note:** A user's first name is mandatory. Because of this, take these two
| points into consideration when configuring a locale's user name settings:
| 
| - The `first-name` field can't be removed from the field names list.
| 
|         lang.user.name.field.names=prefix,first-name,middle-name,last-name,suffix
| 
| - Because a first name is required, it's always implicitly included in the
|   *required field names* property:
| 
|         lang.user.name.required.field.names=last-name
| 
|     Therefore, any fields you enter here are *in addition to* the first name
|     field. Last name is required by default, but you can disable it by deleting
|     its value from the property:
| 
|         lang.user.name.required.field.names=
| 
|     In that case, only a first name would be required.







Â¡Muy excelente! Localizing the forms for adding and editing users is
accomplished using the same method by which @product@'s UI messages are
localized: overriding one of its `Lanuguage_xx.properties` files.

## Identifying User Initials

The default avatar displays a user's initials. Some cultures use initials
differently, so there's a way to configure them in the `Language.properties`
file.

    lang.user.default.portrait=initials
    lang.user.initials.field.names=first-name,last-name

The `lang.user.default.portrait` property sets the type of portrait to use for
users. This can be set to `initials` or `image`. If set to `image`, the default
images defined by the `image.default.user.female.portrait` or
`image.default.user.male.portrait` properties residing in the
`portal.properties` file are used. Therefore, the
`lang.user.initials.field.names` property is ignored.

![Figure 3: The user's initials are displayed for their avatar by default.](../../images/initials-avatar.png)

If you're leveraging the user's initials for the default avatar, the
`lang.user.initials.field.names` property is used to organize how the initials
are displayed. Valid values for this property include `first-name`,
`middle-name`, and `last-name`, in any order.

Now you can manage how a user's initials are displayed!

## Right to Left or Left to Right?

The first three properties in the `Language.properties`'s Language Settings
section change the direction in which the language's characters are displayed.
Most languages are read from left to right, but some languages are read from
right to left (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian). You can also change it for
languages that have been traditionally displayed left to right (like English) as
a funny practical joke. Just don't tell anyone that you got the idea here.

Here's what the relevant language properties look like for a language that
should be displayed from right to left:

    lang.dir=rtl
    lang.line.begin=right
    lang.line.end=left

With these customizations, you can transform your UI into a user-friendly
environment no matter where your users are from.
