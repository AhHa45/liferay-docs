# Headless REST APIs

@product@'s headless REST APIs follow the 
[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) 
specification and let your apps consume RESTful web services. What's more, you 
can consume these APIs without being tied to @product@'s UI (hence the term 
*headless*). This gives you a great deal of freedom when designing and 
developing your apps. 

Here, you'll learn how to navigate and consume @product@'s headless REST APIs.
