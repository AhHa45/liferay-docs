# Export/Import

The Export/Import feature lets users export content from the portal and import
external content into the portal. Providing the export feature in your
application gives users the flexibility of exporting content they've created in
your application to other places, such as another portal instance, or to save
the content for a later use. Import does the opposite: it brings the data from a
LAR file into your portal.

For instance, suppose you're managing an online education course. Because of the
nature of an online course, the site's data (grades, assignments, etc.) is
purged every semester to make way for new incoming students. In a scenario like
this, there is a need to frequently store a complete record of all data given
during a course. The institution offering the course must keep records of the
course's data for a minimum number of years. To abide by these requirements,
having a gradebook application with an export/import feature would let you clear
the application's data for a new semester, but save the previous class's work.
You could export the students' grades as a LAR file and save it outside the
course's site. If the grades ever needed to be accessed again, you could import
the LAR and view the student records.
