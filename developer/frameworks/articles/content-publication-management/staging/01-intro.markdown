# Staging

Staging lets you change your Site behind the scenes without affecting the live
Site, and then you can publish all the changes in one fell swoop. If you include
staging support in your application, your users can stage its content until it's
ready.

For example, if you have an application that provides information intended only
during a specific holiday, supporting the Staging environment lets users save
your application's assets specific for that holiday. They'll reside
in the Staging environment until they're ready for publishing. To learn more
about Staging, visit the
[Staging Content for Publication](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-2/staging-content-for-publication)
section.

Keep in mind that Staging leverages the Export/Import framework. When publishing
your staged content to the live Site, you're essentially importing content from
the staged Site and exporting it to the live Site. You can visit the
[Export/Import](/developer/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/7-2/export-import)
framework's articles for the base APIs that both it and the Staging frameworks
share. In this section of articles, you'll learn about the Staging-specific
configurations that are not shared by Export/Import.
