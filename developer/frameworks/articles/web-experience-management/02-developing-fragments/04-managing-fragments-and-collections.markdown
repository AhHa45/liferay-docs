# Managing Fragments and Collections

After you create Collections and Fragments, you have a handful of options for 
managing them. You'll explore several management options next.

## Collections Management Menu

To access the collections management menu,

1.  Select the Collection you want to manage from the *Collections* list.

2.  Click on the ![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png) menu next to the 
    collection name.
 
3.  Select whether you want to *Edit*, *Export*, *Import*, or *Delete* the
    collection.

    **Edit**: change the name or description for the collection.

    **Export**: download a `.zip` file containing the full collection.

    **Import**: select a `.zip` file to upload with additional Fragments.

    **Delete**: remove the current collection and all of its contents.

Next, you'll learn about the Fragment Management Menu.

Toolkit.
