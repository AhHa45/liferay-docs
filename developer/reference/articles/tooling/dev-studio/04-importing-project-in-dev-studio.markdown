# Importing Projects in Dev Studio

There are two types of Liferay projects you can import into Dev Studio:

- Liferay Module Project (this also includes WAR-style projects)
- Liferay Workspace Project

To import a pre-existing Liferay project into Dev Studio, follow the steps
outlined below:

1.  Right-click in the Project Explorer and select *Import* &rarr; *Liferay
    Module Project*. If you're interested in importing an entire Liferay
    Workspace, select the *Liferay Workspace Project* instead.

    ![Figure 1: You can import a single project or folder of projects.](../../../images/import-liferay-project.png)

    Once you've selected your project(s), the project build type is displayed.

    Note that Dev Studio cannot automatically import Liferay projects into a
    Liferay Workspace. You must copy your projects into a workspace and
    configure them manually.

2.  Click *Finish*.

Now your Liferay project is available from the Package Explorer.
