# Bundle Generator Commands

[TOC levels=1-4]

The generated OSGi bundle automatically includes this for you. The npm 
commands below are also available:

- `npm run build`: Places the output of liferay-npm-bundler in the designated 
  output folder. The standard output is a JAR file that can be deployed manually 
  to @product@. 

- `npm run deploy`: 

- `npm run start`: Tests the application in a local webpack installation instead 
  of a @product@ server. This speeds up development because you can see live 
  changes without the need to deploy. Note, however, that because it's outside
  a Liferay instance, you don't have access to Liferay's APIs. 

| **Note:** By default, the webpack server uses port 8080, which conflicts with
| the port used by Tomcat. You can point the 
| webpack server to a different port by setting the `port` key in `.npmbuildrc`:
| 
| ```json
| "webpack": {
|   "port": 2070
| }
| ```

- `npm run translate`: Runs the translation features for your bundle. Note that 
  this feature requires Microsoft Translator credentials. See 
  [Using Translation Features in Your Widget](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/using-translation-features-in-your-widget) 
  for more information.
