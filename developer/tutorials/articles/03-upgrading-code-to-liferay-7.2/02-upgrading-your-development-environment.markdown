# Upgrading Your Development Environment

A Liferay Workspace is a generated environment that is built to hold and manage
your Liferay projects. It is intended to aid in the management of Liferay
projects by providing various build scripts and configured properties.

You must set up your workspace development environment before you begin
upgrading your custom apps.

## Installing a Liferay Workspace

First, you must install a Liferay Workspace instance in the Code Upgrade
Planner. You can do this by creating a new workspace or importing an existing
one.
