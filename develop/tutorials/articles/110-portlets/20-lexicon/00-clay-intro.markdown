# Applying Clay Styles to your App [](id=applying-lexicon-styles-to-your-app)

It's important to have a consistent user experience across your apps. Liferay's
built-in apps achieve this by using Clay, the web implementation of the
[Liferay Lexicon Experience Language](https://dev.liferay.com/participate/liferaypedia/-/wiki/Main/Lexicon).
Clay is optimized to provide you with a consistent, user-friendly UI for your
Liferay apps.

Clay is included in all themes based on the `_styled` base theme. The `_styled`
base theme uses Bootstrap with a Lexicon base, giving you access to all the
components documented on the [Clay site](http://liferay.github.io/clay/).
<!-- Change this to the new Clay site once it is fully built -->
This means that you can use Clay markup and components in your custom Liferay
apps. Note that you may not need to apply all the changes covered in this
section to your app. The information provided in these tutorials outline
under what use cases you should apply the Clay patterns to your app.

The tutorials in this section cover the following topics:

- Configuring your portlet title and back link
- Applying Clay patterns to your forms, navigation, and more
- Using the Add Button pattern
- Implementing the Management Bar
- Configuring your admin app's actions menu
- Setting search container animations
- Using Clay icons in your app
