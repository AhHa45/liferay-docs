# Applying Lexicon Styles to your App [](id=applying-lexicon-styles-to-your-app)

It's important to have a consistent user experience across your apps. Liferay's 
built-in apps achieve this by using the 
[Liferay Lexicon Experience Language](https://dev.liferay.com/participate/liferaypedia/-/wiki/Main/Lexicon).
Lexicon is optimized to provide you with a consistent, user-friendly UI for your 
Liferay apps.

Lexicon is included in all themes based on the `_styled` base theme. The 
`_styled` base theme uses Bootstrap with a Lexicon base, giving you access to 
all the components documented on the [Clay site](http://liferay.github.io/clay/).
<!-- Explain why Lexicon is on the Clay site -->
This means that you can use Lexicon markup and components in your custom Liferay 
apps. These tutorials explain how to apply Liferay Lexicon design patterns to 
your app to achieve the same look and feel as @product@'s built-in apps. 

The tutorials in this section cover the following topics:

- Configuring your portlet title and back link
- Applying Lexicon patterns to your forms, navigation, and more
- Using the Add Button pattern
- Implementing the Management Bar
- Configuring your admin app's actions menu
- Setting search container animations
- Using Lexicon icons in your app
