# Applying Lexicon Styles to your App [](id=applying-lexicon-styles-to-your-app)

It's important to have a consistent user experience across your apps. Liferay's 
built-in apps achieve this by utilizing Liferay's 
[Lexicon Experience Language](https://lexicondesign.io/) and it's web 
implementation, [Lexicon](https://liferay.github.io/clay/).

Lexicon is optimized to provide you with a consistent, user-friendly UI for your 
Liferay apps, and is included in all themes that are based on the `_styled` base theme. Giving you access to all the components documented on the [Lexicon site](https://liferay.github.io/clay/).

This means that you can use Lexicon markup and components in your custom Liferay 
apps. These tutorials explain how to apply Liferay Lexicon design patterns to 
your app to achieve the same look and feel as @product@'s built-in apps. 

The tutorials in this section cover the following topics:

- Configuring your portlet title and back link
- Applying Lexicon patterns to your forms, navigation, and more
- Using the Add Button pattern
- Implementing the Management Bar
- Configuring your admin app's actions menu
