# Customizing

In @product@, [portlets](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/portlets)
let you add functionality and
[themes](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/themes-and-layout-templates)
let you style your sites. But how do you modify and add to existing
functionality in @product@ and portlets? How do you change their content? The
*Customizing* tutorials answer these questions and demonstrate how to affect
your site in the following ways:
 
-   Add, modify, or remove content from @product@ and portlets
-   Modify behavior
-   Perform actions that respond to events
