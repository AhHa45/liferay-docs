# Deleting Folders

Deleting folders is similar to 
[deleting files](liferay.com). 
There are two methods you can use to delete a folder. Click each method to see 
its Javadoc: 

-   [`deleteFolder(long folderId)`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html#deleteFolder-long-) 

-   [`deleteFolder(long repositoryId, long parentFolderId, String name)`](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/service/DLAppService.html#deleteFolder-long-long-java.lang.String-) 

Which method you use is up to you---they both delete a folder.
