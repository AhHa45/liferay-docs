# Documents and Media API [](id=documents-and-media-api)

@product@'s Documents and Media library lets users upload files to the portal 
and then manage and use them as desired. Once uploading files to the portal, for 
example, users can include them in content, organize them in folders, edit and 
collaborate on them with other users, and more. For more information on the 
Documents and Media library and its features, see 
[its user guide documentation](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-documents-and-media). 

A powerful API underlies the Documents and Media Library's functionality. You 
can leverage this API in your own apps to provide access to these features. For 
example, you could create an app that lets users upload files to the Documents 
and Media Library. 

The tutorials in this section show you how to use the Documents and Media 
Library's API. This is a relatively big API, which may seem daunting at first. 
To keep backwards compatibility, the API has different entry points and multiple 
methods or classes with similar functionality. Fortunately, you don't need to 
learn all of them. These tutorials therefore focus on the classes and methods 
that you'll need to use in most cases.
