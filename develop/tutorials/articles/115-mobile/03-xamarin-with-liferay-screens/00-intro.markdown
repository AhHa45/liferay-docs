# Using Xamarin with Liferay Screens [](id=using-xamarin-with-liferay-screens)

Liferay Screens for 
[Android](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/android-apps-with-liferay-screens) 
and 
[iOS](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/ios-apps-with-liferay-screens) 
lets you use *Screenlets* to develop native mobile apps on each platform. 
Screenlets are complete visual components that you insert in your app to 
leverage @product@'s content and services. But what if you want to use these 
Screenlets to develop hybrid mobile apps that can run on both platforms? You're 
in luck! As of Liferay Screens 3.0, you can use 
[Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) 
with Liferay Screens to develop hybrid mobile apps for Android and iOS. 

The tutorials in this section show you how to develop hybrid mobile apps using 
Liferay Screens and Xamarin. You'll start by preparing your Xamarin project for 
Screens. You'll then learn how to use Screenlets in Xamarin, as well as how to 
customize their appearance, and more.
