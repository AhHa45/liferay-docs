# Lexicon and Themes [](id=lexicon-and-themes)

Lexicon is an extension of Bootstrap's CSS Framework. Bootstrap is by far the 
most popular CSS framework on the web. Also, it's open source, so anyone can use 
it. Built with Sass, Lexicon fills the front-end gaps between Bootstrap and the 
specific needs of @product@.

These tutorials look briefly at Lexicon and show you how to use it in your 
@product@ themes.
