# Internationalization [](id=internationalization)

DXP makes it easier than ever to localize content and design apps for different
locales. DXP lets you centralize messages (language keys) and facilitates manual
and automatic translation. It also supports localizing forms and setting text
directionality from left-to-right or right-to-left. Customizing messages in DXP
and apps is easy too. Internationalization is a snap with DXP!
