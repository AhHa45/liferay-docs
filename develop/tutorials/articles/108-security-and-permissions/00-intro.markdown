# Security and Permissions

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Java portlet standard defines a simple security scheme using portlet roles 
and their mapping to portal roles. On top of this, Liferay provides a 
fine-grained permissions system that you can use to implement access security 
in your portlets. Here, you'll find an overview of the standard Java security
system, Liferay's permission system, and you'll learn how to use them in your
own portlets.

This section's tutorials cover the following topics: 

- Using Portal Roles in a Portlet

- Adding Permissions to Resources

- Adding and Deleting Resources

- Exposing the Permission Interface to Users

- Checking Permissions

- Creating a Custom Action Key
