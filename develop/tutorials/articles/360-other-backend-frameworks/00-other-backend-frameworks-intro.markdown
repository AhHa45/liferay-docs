# Back-end Frameworks

What are DXP's back-end frameworks? Are they important? If so, why aren't they
upfront and centered in the official docs? Good questions.

Back-end frameworks are analogous to supporting actors and actresses in show
business. They fill out the stories in films we know and love. Of course we
intently follow the protagonist through the plot that unwinds on the silver
screen, but we rely on actors in supporting roles to understand the main
character's back story and to bring their character's interesting qualities to
the story. 

Here are some terrific performances by actors and actresses in supporting roles:

-   Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn in *The Aviator* (2004): Her portrayal
    of Katherine Hepburn gave us sympathy the paranoid Howard Hughes.  

-   Jack Nicholson as U.S. Marine Corps Col. Nathan R. Jessup  in *A Few Good 
    Men* (1992): In this courtroom drama, audiences watched Nicholson's
    character Jessup transform from confident and cocky, to agitated, to irate. 
    
    As these actors and actresses brought richness and life to their films,
Liferay's powerful back-end frameworks bring essential services and deliver
terrific performances of their own. Here are some of the frameworks:

- Device Recognition
- Portlet Providers
- Data Scopes
- Message Bus
- Audits
- Background Tasks

These frameworks and more deliver smashing performances and are stars in their
own right.
