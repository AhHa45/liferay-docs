# Arquillian Extension for Liferay Example

[TOC levels=1-4]

[Arquillian](http://arquillian.org) is an extensible Java testing platform
that's designed to make integration testing easy. Arquillian manages the
lifecycle of setting up, starting, or connecting to a container (e.g., Tomcat),
packaging your test cases and any dependent classes or resources, deploying them
to the container, running the tests in the container, and capturing and
reporting the results. The
[Arquillian Extension for Liferay](https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-liferay)
is a set of tools designed to help developers test their Liferay plugins.

The
[Arquillian Blade Example project](https://github.com/liferay-labs/arquillian-blade-example)
demonstrates performing integration and functional tests using the
[Arquillian Liferay Extension](https://github.com/liferay-labs/arquillian-liferay).
Additionally it measures code coverage using
[JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/).
In this tutorial, you'll learn how the Arquillian Liferay Extension and JaCoCo
work. You can download the Arquillian Blade Example project
[here](https://portal.liferay.dev/documents/113763090/114000186/arquillian-blade-example.zip)
or access its latest code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/liferay-labs/arquillian-blade-example).
