# JAX-RS and JAX-WS [](id=jax-rs-and-jax-ws)

@product@ supports JAX-RS and JAX-WS web services. You can create and consume 
these web services much as you would outside of @product@. There are, however, 
a few things you should be aware of. The tutorials in this section discuss these 
things and show you how to use JAX-RS and JAX-WS in @product@.
