# GDPR: Right to be Forgotten and Data Portability

Enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) begins May 25,
2018. Companies processing the personal data of EU residents must adopt
appropriate measures to protect their user data. A wealth of available
resources discuss the implications of the regulation and the steps
companies must take to ensure compliance lest they potentially incur heavy
fines.

The goal of this article is to help you tackle two of GDPR's technically
challenging requirements, the 
[right to data portability](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/) 
and the 
[right to be forgotten](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/) 
on Liferay Portal 6.2. For the upcoming release of Digital Enterprise 7.1, this 
[blog post](https://web.liferay.com/web/dennis.ju/blog/-/blogs/upcoming-gdpr-focused-features-for-liferay-d-1)
describes new features to more easily tackle these requirements. These same
features will be available for @product@ version 7.0 in a future service pack
release following the release of @product@ version 7.1. Until then, the
principles and code described here equally apply to versions 6.2 and 7.0.

The code provided here is meant to be used as an example solution. You could
provide code like this in a script, or in a web plugin.
