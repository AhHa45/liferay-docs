# Enabling Staging and Export/Import

Your Guestbook application creates guestbooks and entries that are immediately
published when they're saved. Sites constantly change, however, so it's crucial
to have an area where updates can be planned and tested before publishing
to your audience. Staging enables changing your Site behind the scenes without
affecting the live Site. When you're done, you can publish all the changes at
once. 

Next, you'll implement Staging support in your Guestbook app so its entries can
be tracked during the Staging phase of your publishing process.

Export/Import facilitates extracting data so it can be imported into another
@product@ installation. Behind the scenes, Export/Import is used during the
Staging process. When publishing your staged content to the live Site, you're
essentially importing content from the staged Site and exporting it to the live
Site. Since the Export/Import framework is programmatically similar to Staging,
you can implement it with Staging.
