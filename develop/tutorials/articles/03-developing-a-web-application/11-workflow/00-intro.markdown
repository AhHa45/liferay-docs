# Approving Content with Workflow

The Guestbook application accepts content from guest users. There's no telling
what what will end up on site pages with the Guestbook deployed. Illegal data,
objectionable content, the entire contents of Moby Dick, all of these and more
are possibilities. Ensure user created content is reviewed and approved by
enabling workflow in your application. 

<!-- Review and approval might be necessary
for a number of reasons:

-  Preventing the posting of illegal data
-  Ensuring that no objectionable content is published, such as profanity,
   images, or any other violation of the terms of use 
-  Protecting the quality of published content 
-->
This Learning Path instructs the reader in workflow-enabling the Guestbook
App's `Guestbook` and `Entry` entities to ensure that only approved content is
published after review.
