# Installing Liferay @ide@

Liferay @ide@ is a plugin for Eclipse that brings many Liferay-specific features
to the table. You can install it into your existing Eclipse environment, or
Liferay provides a bundled version. In this tutorial, you'll learn the different
methods available for installing Liferay @ide@.

## Install the Liferay @ide@ Bundle

1.  Download and install [Java](http://java.oracle.com). Liferay runs on Java, so
    you'll need it to run everything else. Because you'll be developing apps for
    Liferay Portal in Liferay @ide@, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required.
    It is an enhanced version of the Java Environment used for developing new
    Java technology. You can download the Java SE JDK from the Java
    [Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    page. 

2.  Download Liferay's latest
    [Project SDK with @ide@](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20IDE/)
    executable that correlates to your operating system. The Project SDK
    includes @ide@,
    [Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/liferay-workspace),
    and [Blade CLI](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/blade-cli).

3.  Run the Project SDK executable and step through the installer to install
    everything to your machine. For help with setting up proxy settings (if
    necessary), see the
    [Liferay IDE Proxy Settings](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/setting-proxy-requirements-for-liferay-ide)
    and
    [Liferay Workspace Proxy Settings](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/setting-proxy-requirements-for-liferay-workspace)
    tutorials for more information.

Congratulations! You've installed Liferay @ide@!
