# Identifying Liferay Artifact Versions for Dependencies

When you're developing a @product@ application, it's often necessary to use 
various @product@ APIs or tools. For example, you might want to create a Service 
Builder application or use @product@'s message bus or asset framework. How can 
you determine which versions of @product@ artifacts (modules, apps, etc.) your 
application's modules need to specify as dependencies? To learn how to find and 
configure @product@ dependencies, please refer to the following tutorial:
