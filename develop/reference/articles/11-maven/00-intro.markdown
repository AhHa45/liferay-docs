[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay provides plugins that you can apply to your Maven project. This
reference documentation describes configuration properties for your Maven
project's `pom.xml` for each plugin. If you're looking for instructions on using
Maven with your Liferay modules, see the 
[Maven tutorials](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/maven).
