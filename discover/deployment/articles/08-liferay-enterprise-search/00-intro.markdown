# Installing a Search Engine

[TOC levels=1-4]

Search engines are a critical component of your @product@ installation. They allow
you to provide documents in an index that can quickly be searched, rather than
relying on expensive database queries. For more fundamental material on search
and indexing in @product@, read
[here](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/introduction-to-liferay-search).
If you're here, you probably know the basics already and want to get started on
configuring a search engine for your @product@ deployment. 

@product@ ships with Elasticsearch, a highly scalable, full-text search engine.
Elasticsearch is well supported and will almost certainly meet any search and
indexing need you have. For deployment settings, learn to configure a
standalone, or remote, Elasticsearch server or cluster
[here](/docs/7-0/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/configuring-elasticsearch-for-liferay-0).

If you need to use Solr, it's also supported in @product@, and you can read more
about its configuration [here](/docs/7-0/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/using-solr).
