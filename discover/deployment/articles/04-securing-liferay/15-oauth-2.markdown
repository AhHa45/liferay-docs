# OAuth 2.0 

OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization protocol. Users can seamlessly
share select credentials from another website to log into yours. You've probably
seen this before: any time you see a "Log In with Facebook," or "Log In with
Google" button, or you authorize a third-party Twitter client, you're seeing
OAuth 2.0 in action. It works by authorizing password-less access to portions of
user-owned resources (such as an email address, a user profile picture, or
something else from your account). 

OAuth 2.0's design encrypts all authorization transport through HTTPS, which
prevents data passed between the systems from being intercepted. 

Question: how in the UI can users revoke authorization?
