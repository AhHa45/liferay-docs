# Installing a Search Engine [](id=installing-a-search-engine)

Search engines are a critical component of your @product@ installation. They
create an index that can be searched, rather than relying on expensive database
queries. If you're here, you probably know the basics already and want to get
started on configuring a search engine for your @product@ deployment. 

@product@ ships with Elasticsearch, a highly scalable, full-text search engine.
Elasticsearch is well supported and almost certainly meets any search and
indexing need you have. For deployment settings, learn to configure
a standalone or remote Elasticsearch server or cluster
[here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-elasticsearch).

<!-- If you need to use Solr, it's also supported in @product@, and you can read more
about its configuration [here](discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-solr).-->
