# Deprecated Apps in 7.1: What to Do

During the development of any software product, it's sometimes necessary to stop 
development on or remove outdated or unpopular features. @product-ver@ is no 
different. Liferay has deprecated several apps in @product-ver@. It's important 
to note what, exactly, *deprecated* means here. All apps deprecated by Liferay 
are no longer in active development. Such an app, however, may still be 
available. There are 3 types of deprecated apps: 

1.  Deprecated apps that remain in @product@, but will be removed in some future 
    release. You should therefore plan to stop using any such apps. 

2.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from @product@, yet are still 
    available for download via Liferay Marketplace or Liferay's public 
    repository. 

3.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from @product@, and aren't available 
    for download elsewhere. 

This article lists the apps deprecated in @product-ver@, and tells you if 
they're still available. Note that Nexus is Liferay's public repository.
