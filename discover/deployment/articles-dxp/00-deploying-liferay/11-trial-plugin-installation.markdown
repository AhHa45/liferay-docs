# Trial Plugin Installation

For Liferay customers who are evaluating @product@ on a trial basis, **the
plugins can be accessed from within the *Apps* &rarr; *Store* (i.e.,
Marketplace) section of the Control Panel in your product installation**. 

*At a later date, the Marketplace website on Liferay.COM will be accessible to
@product@ trial customers. For now, please access EE Plugins through the portal
installation itself.* 

## Installation Process

Follow the steps below to install a trial plugin:

1.  Sign in to your Liferay.COM account (LRDC) on Liferay's home page. If you
    don't have an account, register by clicking the same link. 

    ![Figure 1: Hover over the Profile button and click *Sign In/Create Account*.](../../images-dxp/liferay-com-sign-in.png)

2.  Start your @product@ instance (trial license is OK).

3.  After signing in as an Admin in your @product@ trial server, go to the
    Control Panel &rarr; *Apps* &rarr; *Store* and configure the Liferay.COM
    (LRDC) account to log in to the Marketplace. Authorize Marketplace to access
    your local account.

    ![Figure 2: Click the *Store* link and authorize Marketplace to access your local account.](../../images-dxp/dxp-store-link.png)

4.  Once signed into the Store, click on the *Purchased* link, and then click on
    the *EE* subtab.

    ![Figure 3: The trial plugins are available as plugins already purchased.](../../images-dxp/dxp-store-ee.png)

    Here you can see a list of @product@ plugins that are installed, as well as
    options to update or install certain plugins. To install a plugin, click the
    *Install* button located to the far right of the respective plugin.
    Similarly, click the *Update* button to update a plugin.

Trial users have access to the Customer Portal during their trial. This also
includes access to the @product@-specific plugins from the Liferay
[Marketplace website](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace) on Liferay.COM
(LRDC). Trial users do not have access to Liferay's customer Knowledge Base and
LESA (Liferay's support ticketing system).

**Note:** Liferay is currently working on providing access to @product@ plugins
on the Marketplace website for @product@ trial customers, which would also
include access from within the @product@ installation.

## FAQ

**Q:** Where are the *@product@ Trial Plugins*?

**A:** There is no such thing. The @product@ Plugins in Liferay Marketplace are
the same ones that you get to try out with your @product@ trial license for your
portal. The @product@ license (trial or official @product@ subscriber) gives you
access to the @product@ plugins. Also, there is no difference code-wise or
release-wise between a @product@ trial installation and a regular @product@
non-trial installation. The only difference is the license.

**Q:** Why can't I go to liferay.com/marketplace? Why can't I *purchase* from
the Marketplace site?

**A:** DXP trial users must use the Marketplace accessed from within the
product's Control Panel (instructions above). You do not need to *purchase* any
DXP plugins because if you access Marketplace from within the Control Panel,
Marketplace sees that you have a DXP license installed and gives access to DXP
plugins. Official DXP subscription customers (i.e., non trial) will be able to
log into liferay.com with their designated DXP subscriber login and access all
DXP plugins through the Marketplace website. 

**Q:** Why are the plugins under the Purchased tab? If I click on the
*DXP Marketplace* link, it does not let me get the DXP plugins.

**A:** Once you're signed into the Store, click on the *Purchased* tab,
then click on the *EE* subtab.

**Q:** What happens when DXP trial customers become official Liferay Digital
Experience subscribers?

**A:** They will still be able to complete the above process, or they
can also visit the
[Liferay Marketplace website](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace).

**Q:** Do DXP trial customers get the DXP source code?

**A:** No, they can only install the plugin. The DXP source code becomes
available once they are official @product@ Enterprise subscribers.

**Q:** Can this process of installing DXP plugins be used from Liferay Portal CE
(Community Edition)?

**A:** No, the Marketplace must detect that you are running @product@.
