# Workflow Forms [](id=workflow-forms)

Business processes are often form-based and workflow-driven. They start with 
data that needs to be entered, and progress by sending those data to other 
people or groups. The initial data are processed in some way (for example, 
further data is entered or approval is granted), and the process moves on until
completion, when each interested party has seen and manipulated the data. To 
write an app for each of these processes is laborious. Instead, a tool for 
quickly defining a process to suit each use case is needed. The process 
architect must define the data that gets collected and the process the data 
moves through to reach its final state. To accomplish this, @product@ already 
includes the 
[Dynamic Data Lists app](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-data-definitions)
for defining forms, and the 
[Kaleo Designer app](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/kaleo-designer) 
for designing workflows. The Kaleo Forms solution combines the features of these
apps, letting you use a single UI to design an integrated process for sending 
forms through a workflow. 

Here are the steps for using Kaleo Forms for creating a workflow process for a 
form:

1.  Create a Kaleo Process.

2.  Create the process's field set (or select an existing 
    [data definition](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-data-definitions)). 

3.  Create the process's workflow definition (or select an existing one). 

4.  Create and assign forms for each workflow task. 

The articles in this section walk you through these steps.
