# Creating a User Group

Follow these steps to create a user group: 

1.  Opening the Menu 
    (![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)) 
    and select *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users Groups*. Any existing user groups 
    appear here in a table. 

2.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Menu](../../../images/icon-add.png)). 
    This opens the *New User Group* form. 

3.  Give your user group a name and description. 

4.  If you want to create My Profile and My Dashboard pages for the user group's 
    members, then select a page layout to use from the *My Profile* and 
    *My Dashboard* selector menus. 

5.  Click *Save*. The new user group then appears in the table. 

Note that new user groups don't have any users. The next section shows you how 
to add members to a user group.
