# Polls

How can The Lunar Resort stay connected with its earthbound clientele from
239,000 miles away? Make them feel really involved and enthusiastic about the
resort by asking them for feedback. You're not just creating a poll, you're
making connections.

Use Polls to find out what your site visitors are thinking and keep them engaged
with your site's content.

Two applications are involved in making and displaying a poll: the *Polls*
application accessed through the Site Menu, and the *Polls Display* widget
that's added to a page.

From the Site Menu, set up the poll question and possible answers users can
select. The Polls application lets users and administrators create
multiple-choice polls and keep track of the votes.  Many separate polls can be
managed at once.

Use the Polls Display widget to display the poll on a page so users can vote.
The Polls Display widget allows users to vote for a specific poll's questions
and see the results. Questions are created from the Polls application in the
Site Menu, or directly in the Polls Display widget on a page.

## Creating a Poll [](id=creating-a-poll)

From the Site Menu, go to *Content* &rarr; *Polls*. 

1.  Click the ![Add](../images/icon-add.png) button. A form appears that allows
    you to fill out all the information for your poll.

    ![Figure 1: Besides the Title and the Polls Question, you must enter data for each of the Choices fields when creating a new poll.](../images/polls-add-new-question.png)

    **Title:** (Required) Enter the name of the poll question. 

    **Polls Question:** (Required) Enter the text of the poll question. 

    **Expiration Date:** Enter the date and time you want the poll to expire. 

    **Choices:** Enter at least two options for the poll question. 

    **Add Choice:** Enter additional answer options for the poll question. 

    **Permissions:** Manage who can view and edit the poll. 

2.  Click *Save*, and the poll is added to the Polls application. 

Once a poll is created, it is accessible through the Polls Display portlet until
it expires or is deleted. Set an expiration date for a poll by selecting
the day and time in the Add Poll form. The default is set to *Never Expire*. 

When a poll expires, users can't enter votes any more, but if a Polls Display
portlet is still publishing it, the poll results are displayed on the page. To
remove an expired poll from a page, remove the Poll Display portlet or
configure it to show another poll question. See the section below for more
details about the Polls Display portlet. 

*Permissions* are set on individual polls. Use permissions, for example, to
allow some privileged users to vote on a certain poll question, while others can
only view it. 

Creating a poll is fairly straightforward. Next, complete the two-step
process and put your poll on a page.

## Adding a Poll to a Page [](id=adding-a-poll-to-a-page)

Now that you have created your poll question, it's time to present it to your
users. Follow these steps.

1.  Go to a page and add a Polls Display widget from *Add* &rarr; *Widgets*
    &rarr; *Content Management*.

2.  Click *Please configure this portlet to make it visible to all users.*

3.  In the dialog box that appears, select the title of the poll to display.

4.  Click *Save*.

Once the poll question has been successfully placed on the page, perform
other tasks using the icons at the bottom of the portlet.

as to some of the Polls Application's functionality.](../images/poll-buttons.png)

**Edit Question:** Displays a similar dialog box to the one used to create the
poll. 

**Select Poll:** Displays the same dialog box as Configuration, allowing you to
choose different polls from the drop-down menu. 

**Add:** Allows you to create a new poll. 

## Viewing Poll Results [](id=viewing-the-poll-results)

All the polls you create are listed in the Polls portlet in *Site
Administration* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Polls*. When users vote in the poll,
the data is collected here. Click on a poll see a breakdown of the results.

![Figure 3: Selecting a poll in the Polls portlet puts the data at your fingertips.](../images/polls-results.png)

If you click on one of the listed *Charts*, the portlet generates an
appropriate visualization of the data.

Below this is an item called *Charts*. This option shows the poll results
represented in various graphs. The graphs are *Area*, *Horizontal Bar*, *Line*,
*Pie*, and *Vertical Bar*.

![Figure 4: This is what the vertical bar graph for the Lunar Resort poll results looks like.](../images/polls-results-vertical-bar.png)

There is also a listing of the users who voted in your poll, how they voted,
and a time/date stamp of when their votes were cast. Registered users are
represented by name while Guest users are represented by a number.
