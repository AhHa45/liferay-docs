# Integrating with Facebook and Other Social Networks [](id=integrating-with-facebook)

@product@ provides tools for integrating your portal and its content with 
Facebook and other social networks. For example, you can use Facebook for 
authentication and even export widgets as Facebook applications. You can also 
leverage *social bookmarks* to let your users share portal content on a variety 
of social networks. This article shows you how to do these things. 

## Facebook Sign On [](id=facebook-sign-on)

Like many websites you may visit, any site running on @product@ can use
Facebook for sign in. This makes it easier for users to sign in to your 
Site, since they don't need to remember another user name and password. See the
[deployment documentation](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/facebook-connect-single-sign-on-authentication) 
for information on using Facebook to sign into @product@. 

## Using Your Widget as Facebook Applications [](id=using-your-widget-as-facebook-applications)

You can add any @product@ widget as an app on Facebook. To do this, you must 
first get a developer key. A link for doing this is provided to you in the 
Facebook tab in any widget's Configuration screen. You must create the app on 
Facebook and get the key and canvas page URL from Facebook. You can then copy 
and paste their values into the Facebook tab. Once you do that, your widget is 
available on Facebook. 

This integration lets you make things like Message Boards, Calendars, Wikis, and 
other content on your website available to a much larger audience (unless you 
already have a billion users on your site, in which case, kudos to you). If 
you're a developer, you can implement your widget on @product@ and then publish 
it to Facebook. 

## Using Social Bookmarks

Social bookmarks appear below content as buttons that let users share that 
content on social networks. For example, social bookmarks are enabled by default 
in the Blogs widget. The default social bookmarks for Twitter, Facebook, 
LinkedIn, and Google Plus therefore appear below each blog post.

If you want more social bookmarks than the default ones, install the Social 
Bookmarks app from Liferay Marketplace. This app is available for 
[Liferay CE Portal](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15194315) 
and 
[Liferay DXP](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15188453). 
It adds the following social bookmarks: 

-   AddThis
-   Delicious
-   Digg
-   Evernote
-   Reddit
-   Slashdot
