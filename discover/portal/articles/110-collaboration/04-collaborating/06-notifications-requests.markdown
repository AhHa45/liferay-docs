# Managing Notifications and Requests

If you subscribed to a blog or message board, or if someone sent you a
private message, invitation, event reminder, or mentioned you in a post, you
received a notification or request.

The notifications icon on your profile image shows your number of unread
notifications or requests.

To access notifications and requests, you can click the notifications 
icon on your user profile image or open the Menu 
(![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)) 
and select *My Account* &rarr; *Notifications* under your user menu. The 
*Notifications List* tab is selected by default. This is where all your 
notifications are displayed. Click the *Requests List* tab to view and manage 
your requests.

## Managing Notifications

Notifications can pile up after some time, especially if you were away for a few
days. The Management Bar gives you several ways to filter and sort your 
notifications. 

The *Filter and Order* menu gives you the following options for viewing 
notifications:

-   **All:** The default option. Displays both read and unread notifications. 

-   **Unread:** Displays notifications that haven't been marked as read. Unread 
    notifications are indicated with a blue border on the left-hand side of the 
    notification. 

-   **Read:** Displays notifications that have been marked as read. 

-   **Date:** Order notifications by date. 

By default, notifications are listed by date in descending order. To sort 
notifications by ascending order, click the up/down arrow icon in the management 
bar. Clicking the button again reverses the sort. 

Each notification's *Actions* menu 
(![Menu](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) lets you mark the notification as 
read/unread, or delete the notification. 

### Managing Multiple Notifications [](id=managing-multiple-notifications)

You can also manage multiple notifications at once. Select the checkbox next to
notifications you want to manage and choose an option from the Management Bar.
Select the checkbox above the notifications list to select all notifications on
the current page. A blue border on the bottom marks selected notifications.
Selected notifications show three actions: an open envelope button (![Open
Envelope](../../../images/button-envelope-open.png)) (mark as read); a closed
envelope button (![Closed Envelope](../../../images/button-envelope-closed.png))
(mark as unread); and an x button (![Delete
Button](../../../images/button-delete.png)) (delete).

Selecting the *Mark all notifications as read* action in the app's actions menu
marks them as read.

**Note:** This feature is only available if at least one notification is unread. 
Clicking it marks all notifications as read, selected or not.

**This action can not be undone.** You must manually paginate through all 
the notifications and either bulk mark them as unread for the page, or 
individually mark the notifications as unread if you wish to change the state.

## Managing Requests [](id=managing-requests)

When you get a request, it appears in the *Requests List* section. 
In its Action menu, you can click *Confirm* to accept, *Ignore* to decline, or
*Delete* to remove the request.
