# Working Together with the Wiki

@product@ contains a full-featured wiki app that also leverages the portal's 
other features. As such, the wiki is completely integrated 
with the portal's 
[user management](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-management), 
[tagging](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/organizing-content-with-tags), 
and 
[security](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-portal-security) 
features. 

Wikis let users collaboratively build a collection of information. The most 
famous wiki on the planet is Wikipedia. It's a full online encyclopedia 
developed collaboratively by users from all over the world, using a wiki. 

@product@'s Wiki app supports the 
[WikiCreole](http://www.wikicreole.org/) 
syntax. This syntax is a best-of-breed wiki syntax and should be familiar to 
users of other wikis. The app provides a handy syntax cheat sheet on the editing 
form, with a link to WikiCreole's full documentation.

An instance of the Wiki application can be created for each scope: the entire
portal (global), a site, or a page.
