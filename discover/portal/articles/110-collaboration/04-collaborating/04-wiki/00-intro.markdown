# Working Together with the Wiki [](id=working-together-with-the-wiki)

Wikis let users collaboratively build a collection of information. The most 
famous wiki on the planet is Wikipedia. It's a full online encyclopedia 
developed collaboratively by users from all over the world, using a wiki. 
@product@ contains a full-featured wiki app that lets you do the following: 

-   Create multiple wikis in a single wiki app instance. 
-   Scope wikis to a page, a site, or the entire portal. 
-   Create and edit wikis in 
    [WikiCreole syntax](http://www.wikicreole.org/). 
-   Attach files to wiki articles. 
-   Associate wiki articles with other assets in the portal. 
-   And more.

The wiki is completely integrated with the portal's 
[user management](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-management), 
[tagging](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/organizing-content-with-tags), 
and 
[security](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-portal-security) 
features.
