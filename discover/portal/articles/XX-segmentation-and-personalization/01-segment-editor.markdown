At the top of the editor you can set the name, view the current members of the
segment as it is defined, and choose to *Save* the Segment or *Cancel* to 
discard changes.

Below that there are three main sections:

- User Properties

- Organization Properties

- Session Properties

## User Properties

User Properties are the attributes of a specific user that you want to capture.
This is primarily made up of the user's metadata as defined when they are 
created, but also contains certain group memberships (like Roles and User 
Groups) as well as information like the date the user profile was last modified.

## Organization Properties

Organization Properties lets you select specific Organizations to include in your Segment as well as offering similar criteria as is used for user selection, like *Name* and *Date Modified*.

## Session Properties

Session Properties contains criteria based on the user's browser and system 
information. Things like the current browser, screen resolution, and platform. 
You can use this to target categories like "iPhone users" or "Internet Explorer 
Users."
