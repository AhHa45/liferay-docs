# Segmentation and Personalization

Segmentation and Personalization provides a way to evaluate users so that you 
can dynamically provide personal experiences that are relevant to each user. 
For example, if you're building a website for a bank, and you want to provide 
special offers for certain customers, you need a way to only display offers to 
customers who are eligible or likely to be interested in those offers. You 
don't want to display information on a basic free checking account for a 
customer with multiple accounts with very large deposits, but you do want to 
show that information to a college student with a small balance in a savings 
account. Segmentation is the solution for showing both customers what they need.

## Defining Segments

The first part of the equation is defining the types of segments that you need 
for your use case. You can create any number of Segments to capture every case 
that you need for your site. Segments are composed of different criteria and 
cases. In the previous example you might have a segment for *Free Checking 
Account Prospects* that contains customers that don't currently have an open 
checking account. To learn more, you can read the [overview of the Segment 
editor](link), practice [creating basic Segments](link), or create more 
complicated [Segments with custom fields and session data](link).
