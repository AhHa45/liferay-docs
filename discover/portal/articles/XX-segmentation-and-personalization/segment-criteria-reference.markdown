# Defining Segmentation Criteria

There are three categories for defining Segment criteria:

- User Properties
- Organization Properties
- Session Properties

There are several types of information that can be collected by the User Segment interface. Some data is entered in text boxes, while others use selectors to select specific criteria or tools like a date picker. In addition, some fields use a comparator selection, which, depending on the specific context lets you select the relationship between the user or agent data and the criteria:

- *equals*

- *not equals*

- *greater than*

- *greater than or equals*

- *less than*

- *less than or equals*

- *contains*

- *does not contain*

Depending on the nature of the criteria, the comparator selection may contain 
different combinations. For example, the *Date* selection described below 
contains options for all the above option except *contains* and *does not 
contain*, whereas the *Email Address* selection has *equals*, *not equals*, 
*contains* and *does not contain*.

In between each criteria and each category, you can define an "and" or "or" 
operator. For "and" all criteria must be true in order for the criteria to be 
satisfied. With "or" it will be true if any of the defined criteria are true. 
You can also mix operators to create complex cases.
