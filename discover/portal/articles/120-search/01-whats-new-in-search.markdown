# What's New with Search? [](id=whats-new-with-search)

There are lots of new features in the @product-ver@ search functionality. Use
this brief overview to get you familiar with the changes, and learn more details
in the remaining articles.

Modularized Search Functionality
: Users of search in prior versions will think of all the search functionality
existing in one place: the Search portlet. Now each separate feature is
available as its own portlet, so you can drag and drop your way to the perfectly
customized search page. The search configurations that existed in the previous
version are still available, but the setting you're looking for might be in a
slightly different location due to the modularization of search in
@product-ver@. The articles here will help familiarize you with the new look.

Search Administration
: Carry out search administration tasks (like reindexing the search indexes) in
the Search administration application in the Control Panel (Control Panel
&rarr; Configuration &rarr; Search).

Default/Customizable Search Pages
: There's a pre-configured search page template you can use to get a sensible
default search page up and running.

Advanced Search Syntax
: Use Elasticsearch's Query String syntax to create advanced search queries.

Multiple Facet and Term Selection
: Narrow search results using Facets. In @product-ver@, continue refining
results by selecting as many facets and as many terms as necessary. Previously,
only one facet term could be used at a time.

Search System Settings
: Configure system wide search behavior form the Search Web System Settings
entry.

Custom Facets
: Configure custom facets if the existing facets aren't enough for your use
case.

To learn more about using these new features, see the remaining documentation in
this section. And keep in mind that despite the modularization of the search
functionality, the old way of doing search, inside one embedded portlet, is still just
one checkbox away (located in Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr; System
Settings &rarr; Search &rarr; Search Web).
