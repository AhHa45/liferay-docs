# Publishing RSS Feeds [](id=publishing-rss-feeds)

RSS is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated works
such as blog entries and news articles. RSS allows users to stay up-to-date with
your site's content without actually having to visit your site! Instead, they
can subscribe to your site's RSS feed with an RSS feed reader. Their RSS reader
reads your site's RSS feed and displays information about all the web content
that's published on your site, such as each article's title and publication
date. If one of your site's web content articles grabs their attention, then
they can follow their RSS reader's link to the article's full content on your
site. Many RSS readers are available today, including web-based readers, ones
for the Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, and ones for mobile devices. You'll
see how to create RSS feeds in @product@ next.
