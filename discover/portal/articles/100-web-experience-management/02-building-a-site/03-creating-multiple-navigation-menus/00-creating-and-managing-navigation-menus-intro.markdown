# Managing Site Navigation [](id=managing-site-navigation)

Liferay provides straightforward but powerful tools for creating and organizing 
pages. You can create pages in a simple, flat site navigation, or you can 
create sub-pages and build the page hierarchy any way you like.

With @product-ver@, you can create Navigation Menus that are separate from your 
site hierarchy. Navigation Menus let you arrange pages any way you want. 
Marketers can leave one-off marketing landing pages out of the navigation, and 
you can create  multiple navigation menus: a main menu, secondary menus, footer 
menus, and custom menus for anything that you can dream up.

On a large, complex site you can have a Navigation Menu that displays a simple
list of frequently visited pages and move the rest of the pages to secondary
navigation. You can also create specific menus for different landing pages to
direct users to content that is relevant to them.

Go to *Navigation* &rarr; *Pages* to view the existing pages or
create new pages. The site hierarchy as displayed on *Pages* is the main 
reference for the organization of pages on that Site. While Navigation Menus 
can customize their organization and what appears and what doesn't appear, this 
menu is always the primary reference for the pages on your Site.
