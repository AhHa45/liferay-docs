# Page Hierarchy

Using the Page Hierarchy, you create public and private pages, and organize those pages in whatever order or structure that you see fit.

## Creating a Page

New pages are created on the *Build* &rarr; *Pages* page in Site 
Administration. Pages can be created as *Public Pages* which anyone can view, 
or *Private Pages* which can only be viewed by Site Members. To create a new 
page,

1.  Go to *Site Administration* for the Site you want to work on, then
    *Build* &rarr; *Pages*.

![Figure 1: In the default site, initially only the *Welcome* and the hidden *Search* pages exist in the Public Pages Hierarchy.](../../../../images/default-nav-pages.png)

2.  Click *Add* [Add Page](../../../../images/icon-add.png) and select *Public 
    Page*.
    
3.  Select *Widget Page*.

4.  Set the *Name* as *About Us*.

5.  Click *Save*.

6.  On the next page, note the *Show in Public Page Hierarchy Menu* selection, 
    leave the defaults and click *Save*.

Now that the page is created, it will appear in the Hierarchy, and you can move or organize its position there.

## Organizing Pages

Pages can be dragged and dropped to reorder there position in the page 
hierarchy (and subsequently the default navigation that users will see), and to 
"nest" them as subpages. There is also a *Home* page that users will be 
automatically directed to when they view your site which is automatically 
assigned to whichever page is at the top of the list. Take a look at how this works, now.

1.  First, click *Go to Site* to view the organization of the navigation menu.

2.  You can see the order of the pages matches the order of the pages from
    Site Administration

3.  Drag the *About Us* page so that it is above the *Welcome* page in the list.

    You will see that it automatically becomes the *Home* page.

4.  Now click *Go to Site* again to see the effect this change has on your menu.

![Figure 3: *About Us* is now the home page, and *Welcome* is second in the nav.](../../../../images/navigation-practical2.png)

5.  For your final trick, drag *About Us* directly on top of *Welcome* which will "nest."

6.  Click *Go to Site* one more time to see how nested pages will appear in your
    site.

![Figure 4: *About Us* is now nested under *Welcome* and will appear when you mouse-over *Welcome*.](../../../../images/navigation-practical3.png)

As you've just demonstrated, organizing pages in the default menu is simple, 
but very powerful.

### Public and Private Pages

As noted above, Private Pages work just like Public Pages, only they can only 
be viewed by registered members of a site. In the default configuration, Public 
Pages can be found at the URL `[web-address]/`**web**`/[site-name]` while 
Private Pages are found at `[web-address]/`**group**`/[site-name]`. Other than the membership distinctions, Public and Private Pages share the same behavior.

## Page Options

While managing the default menu, you can also access options for the page. 
Clicking on the *Options* icon [Option](../../../../images/icon-options.png) 
allows you to access several configuration tools:

* **View** goes to the selected page on the site.

* **Configure** goes to page configuration.

* **Copy Page** creates a new page in the current site that will duplicate     
    everything about the select page.

* **Permissions** opens the Permissions dialog where you configure who can   
    access the page.
    
* **Orphan Widgets** allows you to view and clear any data related to widgets 
    that have been removed from the page.
    
* **Delete** will delete the page and all of its data.

Creating and managing pages using the page hierarchy is simple but very 
powerful. However, if you need more options for your pages are displayed you 
can use Navigation Menus to provide more flexibility.
