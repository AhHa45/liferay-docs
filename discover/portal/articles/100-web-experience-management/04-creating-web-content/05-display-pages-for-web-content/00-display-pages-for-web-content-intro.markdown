# Display Pages for Web Content

Display Pages provide a new level of control over the look and feel of your 
content. Display pages empower marketers and designers to creating stunning 
designs for Web Content. Display Pages utilize both Page Fragments and  
Web Content to provide an easier way to create beautiful layouts for displaying 
articles.

One great way to use Display Pages is to create standardized formats for 
articles. If you examine the content on many writing platforms each article
follows a similar format. Usually it's something like this:

-  Header Image

-  Title

-  Main Body

-  Highlighted Quote
    
-  Footer with links to related articles or other content

With Display Pages, you can create standard, reusable formats like this to 
streamline the creation of attractive content. Read on to learn more!
