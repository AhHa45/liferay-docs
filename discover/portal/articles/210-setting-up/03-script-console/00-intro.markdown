# Using Liferay's Script Engine [](id=using-liferays-script-engine)

@product@ provides a robust script engine for executing
[Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)
scripts. The script engine performs back-end tasks like running workflow
scripts, and you can use the engine from the script console to execute scripts to
perform repetitive user maintenance operations, bulk invocations of Liferay's
API, or even system level operations.

These tutorials cover the following scripting topics: 

- [Invoking Liferay services](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/invoking-liferay-services-from-scripts)

- [Running scripts from the script console](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/running-scripts-from-the-script-console)

- [Using the script engine with workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/leveraging-the-script-engine-in-workflow)

- [Script examples](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/script-examples)

Invoking Liferay's services is discussed first because it's part of the most
common scripting tasks. If you're familiar with Liferay's API, this will be very
easy for you.
