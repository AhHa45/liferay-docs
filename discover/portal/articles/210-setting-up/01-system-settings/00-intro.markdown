# System Wide Settings [](id=system-wide-settings)

It can be hard to keep track of where all the configuration interfaces reside.
Fortunately, the Control Panel is most often the place to look, and there's a
tidy *Configruation* section there that houses a lot of the higher level (for
example, system and instance scoped) configuration options. This section
considers the configuration options dealing with the *System* scope.
Configuration at the system level affects all the *Virtual Instances* of Liferay
in the system. If you're not sure what a Virtual Instance is, read the section
on
[Setting Up a Liferay Instance](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/instance-settings).

There are several Control Panel sections with system scoped configurations:

- System Settings

- Server Administration

- Custom Fields
