# Setting Up an Instance [](id=setting-up-an-instance)

Once you have a @product@ installation set up, the configuration begins.
Whether that means adding another virtual instance or setting up the initial
instance to suit your needs. Recall that configuration happens at different
scopes. Here were thinking about the instance scope. There's an important
difference between the system scope and the instance scope. The system scope is
the highest level scope you can make configurations at. All virtual instances of
Liferay are impacted by configuration done at this scope. The instance scope
applies only to one particular virtual instance of Liferay. What are virtual
instances? Separate Liferay installations (with their own virtual host) that
share a server and database. Each instance can be configured differently.

So what kind of configuration do you need to do in your instance? Here's what
