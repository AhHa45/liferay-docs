# Setting Up a Virtual Instance [](id=setting-up-a-virtual-instance)

Once @product@ is installed, the configuration begins. Whether that means adding
another virtual instance or setting up the initial instance to suit your needs.
Recall that configuration happens at different scopes. Here were thinking about
the virtual instance scope. There's an important difference between the system
scope and the instance scope. The system scope is the highest level scope you
can make configurations at. All virtual instances are impacted by configuration
done at this scope. The instance scope applies only to one particular virtual
instance. 

Virtual instances are separate Liferay installations (each with their own
virtual host) that share a server and database. Each instance can be configured
differently.
