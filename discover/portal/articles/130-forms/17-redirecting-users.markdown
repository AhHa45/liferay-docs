# Redirecting Users

Send users to any URL you want upon form submission. You might have a particular
*Thanks for your submission!* type page with a link to the home page, or you
might want to direct a user somewhere specific based on the form they just
submitted. Sometimes all you need is a 
[success page in the form itself](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/success-pages),
but other times you'll want.

Whatever your use case is, set up a redirect URL by 

1.  Opening the form's
Form Settings section (click the *Options*
(![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) button &rarr; *Settings*). 

2.  In the *Redirect URL* just type the URL. That's it.

So, your form is all set up ready to be filled out by users. However, you
haven't configured the permissions yet, so the only user with permission to add
records is you, the owner! There's a good chance you'll want to customize the
form's permissions.
