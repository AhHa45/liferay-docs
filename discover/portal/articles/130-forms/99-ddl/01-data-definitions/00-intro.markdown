# Data Definitions

As explained in the 
[dynamic data lists intro](liferay.com), 
data definitions define a form's fields, while dynamic data lists display that 
form. You create and manage data definitions using @product@'s UI: there's no 
coding necessary. This section shows you how to create and manage data 
definitions. This includes information on configuring your data definition's 
fields to function as desired.
