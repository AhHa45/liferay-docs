# Adapting Your Media across Multiple Devices [](id=adapting-your-media-across-multiple-devices)

People consume content across multiple devices these days. They might be on 
the go, browsing the web on their phone, in a coffee shop checking their 
favorite blogs on their tablet, or at home viewing family photos on their laptop, 
desktop, game system, streaming device, or something else. All these devices 
have different screen sizes, bandwidths, processing capabilities, etc., that 
must be considered when delivering media content. @product@'s' Adaptive Media 
app has you covered. 

Adaptive Media is an Application for Liferay Portal CE 7.0 and Liferay DXP, 
available for download from the [Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace),  
that delivers your media content in the best format, based on the channel 
and device that will consume it. 

This provides faster loading times for devices with a slower connection, saving 
bandwidth, and also gives you administrative control over the image quality 
provided. 

## How It Works [](id=how-it-works)

Portal Administrators define a set of image resolutions to deliver to the user's 
device. Images uploaded thereafter have a copy generated that is scaled to fit 
each of these resolutions. 

Adaptive Media is integrated with Documents and Media and Blogs. Images uploaded 
to Documents and Media or to a Blog Entry are analyzed and processed, generating 
a set of images with the defined resolutions. For instance, when a user is 
reading a blog entry on their mobile phone that contains an image, Adaptive 
Media checks the screen size of the phone and delivers the image that best fits 
the screen. 

Adaptive Media also ensures that your high resolution devices receive a high 
resolution image for the optimal viewing experience. 

## Adding Image Resolutions [](id=adding-image-resolutions)

Portal Administrators can manage Adaptive Media by opening the Control Panel and 
selecting *Adaptive Media* under the *Configuration* heading. 

![Figure 1: Add a new image resolution under the Adaptive Media Configuration. ](../../../images/adaptive-media-configuration.png)

You must specify the image resolutions to generate when a new image is uploaded. 

Note that new resolutions are automatically generated for all images uploaded 
after the resolution is created. However, this is not the case with images that 
have been uploaded before the resolution was created. To apply a new resolution 
to previously uploaded images, you must trigger the process to adapt the 
remaining images. This process is covered in the 
[Generating Missing Image Resolutions section](#generating-missing-image-resolutions). 

+$$$

**Note:** Adaptive Media configurations are scoped per virtual instance. 
Configurations made in an instance will apply to that instance only. 

$$$

To add a new resolution, click the plus button on the bottom right corner of the 
application. 

The following fields are mandatory to create a new image resolution:

- **Title**: a name used for identification purposes (must be unique. No two 
  image resolutions can share the same title.)

- **Maximum Width**: the maximum width of the generated image. If a 
  **Maximum Height** is given, this field is optional. The minimum value 
  possible is 1.

- **Maximum Height**: the maximum height of the generated image. If a 
  **Maximum Width** is given, this field is optional. The minimum value possible 
  is 1.

You must enter either a height or width for the image resolution. Both are not 
required. Images generated by Adaptive Media are scaled to fit the desired 
resolutions, while maintaining their original aspect ratio. Specifying a maximum 
width and height, rather than a specific width and height, ensures that the 
image won’t be distorted to fit a particular size. 

By default, the identifier for the image resolution is automatically generated 
based on the image resolution title. You can specify a custom identifier by 
clicking the radio button next to *Custom* under the *Identifier* heading and 
entering a new ID. The identifier can be used by third party applications to 
obtain the images for that particular resolution via the Adaptive Media APIs.

![Figure 2: Specify an Identifier for an image resolution to make it available in the APIs.](../../../images/adaptive-media-new-img-resolution.png)

You can also create a resolution for high density displays. If the administrator 
selects this option, a new resolution for these devices will be created with the 
same title and the suffix *-2x*. This option is only available when adding new 
image resolutions. These resolutions will have a width and height that is double 
the original. For example, if the original resolution has a Max. Width of 
400px and a Max. Height of 300px, the high density resolution will have a Max. 
Width of 800px and a Max. Height of 600px. 

### How many image resolutions should I add? [](id=how-many-image-resolutions-should-i-add)

The number of image resolutions and the values for each resolution depends on 
the use case. The more image resolutions added, the more optimal the image 
delivery is, but this also requires more storage and computational resources to 
generate these images. Portal Administrators need to find the right balance 
based on their needs.

To start, It’s recommended that you create 4 or 5 resolutions to cover most of 
the common device sizes, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, etc, 
and name them with the device they are targeting. 

If you know that a big percentage of users are using a particular device 
(all the users of the intranet have the same company mobile phone for example), 
you can create a specific resolution to target that particular device. 

## Updating Image Resolutions [](id=updating-image-resolutions)

Portal administrators can modify the title of an existing image resolution if a 
custom identifier is defined. However, **the image resolution and identifier 
can’t be updated if the resolution has already been used to create Adaptive 
Media images**. This prevents inconsistencies in images. Otherwise, if changes 
were made to the resolutions, the images generated before this change would have 
a completely different size than the images created after this change. 

If you need to change the values of an image resolution, you can delete the 
image resolution and create a new one with the appropriate values.

## Disabling, Enabling and Deleting Image Resolutions [](id=disabling-enabling-and-deleting-image-resolutions)

Image resolutions are enabled by default, which means Adaptive Media 
automatically generates images for the resolution when a new image is uploaded. 
This behavior can be disabled if you wish. 

### Disabling Image Resolutions [](id=disabling-image-resolutions)

To disable an image resolution, open the Actions menu next to the image 
resolution and select *Disable*. Any images uploaded after the resolution is 
disabled will instead use the most appropriate image resolution that is still 
active. The images previously generated with the disabled image resolution will 
still be available.

### Enabling Image Resolutions [](id=enabling-image-resolutions)

To enable a disabled image resolution, open the Actions menu next to the image 
resolution and select *Enable*. Note that while an image resolution is disabled 
it doesn’t generate images for new uploads, so after enabling an image 
resolution it’s recommended to generate the images that may have been missed. To 
generate any missing images for an enabled resolution, follow the instructions 
in the [Generating Missing Image Resolutions section](#generating-missing-image-resolutions).

### Deleting Image Resolutions [](id=deleting-image-resolutions)

Portal Administrators can also delete image resolutions. **Proceed with caution 
when deleting an image resolution.** When an image resolution is deleted, no new 
images are generated for that resolution, and all of the previous images 
generated for that resolution are deleted and can no longer be used or 
referenced in any content. **This operation can’t be undone**. 

**To delete a resolution, the image resolution must be disabled first.** This 
acts as a safety guard to ensure that image resolutions are not accidentally 
deleted. Open the Actions menu next to the resolution and select *Disable*. Once 
the resolution is disabled, select *Delete* from the Actions menu to delete the 
resolution and all images that have been generated for the resolution. 

## Generating Missing Image Resolutions [](id=generating-missing-image-resolutions)

There may be cases where an image resolution hasn’t generated all the images 
that you require. For example, if you disable an image resolution and upload new 
images, or perhaps you add a new image resolution that hasn’t been applied to 
existing images. In these kinds of scenarios you will see that the percentage of 
adapted images for an image resolution isn't 100%. 

Portal Administrators can trigger the process to adapt the missing images. Each 
image resolution can be adapted individually by selecting the *Adapt Remaining* 
option from the Actions menu next to the resolution, or all image resolutions 
can be adapted at once by selecting the *Adapt All Images* option from the 
Actions menu in the Control Menu at the top of the page. 

## Creating Content with Adaptive Media Images [](id=creating-content-with-adaptive-media-images)

The power of Adaptive media is its ability to deliver adapted content to each 
user, based on the characteristics of their device.

If the content includes an Adaptive Media Image, instead of displaying a new 
image for everyone, Adaptive Media includes several images 
(one per image resolution) targeting different device capabilities. You can see 
the differences in the HTML of the content in the example below:

HTML for a Blog entry containing a regular image:

    <img src="/documents/20140/0/photo.jpeg/1992-9143-85d2-f72ec1ff77a0 />

HTML for a Blog entry containing an image with Adaptive Media:

    <picture>

        <source media="(max-width:850px)" srcset="/o/adaptive-media/image/44147/med/photo.jpeg">

        <source media="(max-width:1200px) and (min-width:850px)" srcset="/o/adaptive-media/image/44147/hd/photo.jpeg">

        <source media="(max-width:2000px) and (min-width:1200px)" srcset="/o/adaptive-media/image/44147/ultra-hd/photo.jpeg">

        <img src="/documents/20140/0/photo.jpeg/1992-9143-85d2-f72ec1ff77a0">

    </picture>

The example above uses three different images with three different resolutions. 
Additionally, the original image is used as a fallback in case the Adaptive 
Media Images are not available at a particular moment. 

## Deciding the Image Resolutions to Use in Your Content [](id=deciding-the-image-resolutions-to-use-in-your-content)

Adaptive Media delivers the best image possible to a device, based on the 
available image resolutions. However, image resolutions can be added or deleted 
at any time, affecting the content that has references to those images.

To handle this situation, Adaptive Media provides two different approaches you 
can take when creating your content: Using the latest available image 
resolutions or using the resolutions available at the the time the content was 
created. 

## Using the latest available Image Resolutions in the content [](id=using-the-latest-available-image-resolutions-in-the-content)

This is the default scenario for Adaptive Media, and ensures that your content 
uses the latest available resolutions, even if those resolutions were not 
available when the content was created. 

<!-- The above is more of a developer topic
When a user selects an image to be included in their content we do not save the 
links of each of the image resolutions in the content. Instead, we use an 
attribute that identifies the image, and when the image is displayed, Adaptive 
Media automatically updates the content to use the latest available image 
resolutions.
 -->

Note that this solution requires your content to be dynamically replaced when it 
is displayed to ensure that the latest resolutions are used. This could have a 
performance impact if there are lots of users concurrently viewing blog entries.

## Using the Image Resolutions available at the time the content is created [](id=using-the-image-resolutions-available-at-the-time-the-content-is-created)

This scenario saves the image resolutions available when the image is added 
to the content and those are the image resolutions that will be used when the 
content is displayed. 

This solution is better in terms of performance but it has some limitations in 
case new image resolutions are added or existing resolutions are deleted, 
because the content will not reflect the changes in the image resolutions.

<!-- How do I chose this scenario? -->
