# Creating Pages with Layouts

Up to this point, you haven't concerned yourself with arranging content and 
applications on a page. Everything on the Welcome page stretches the width of 
the entire page. But what if we told you that this is something you can control? 
You'd undoubtedly dance a jig of happiness and joy. Well put on your dancing 
shoes, because @product@ lets you use *page layouts* to control how content and 
applications fill each page. For example, the Welcome page has the simplest 
possible layout--1 Column. The entire page is composed of a single column, 
therefore any applications or content in that column take up its full width. You 
can place anything on the page above or below, but not to the side of, any 
existing content or applications. @product@ contains other layouts that arrange 
content into different numbers of columns and rows. This gives you a great deal 
of control over how the applications and content appear in your site. 

Now you'll stop dancing, and create the Activities and About Us pages for the 
Lunar Resort.

## Creating the Activities Page

The activities page will use a 2 column layout with a smaller column on the 
left side and a larger column on the right side.

1. Open the main menu, and go to *Navigation* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2. Click on the menu button for *Public Pages* and select *Add Public Page*.

You are now on the page creation form. You can set the page name, choose a 
template or layout, and set a number of other options.

3. Enter "Activities" for the *Name*.

4. Select *2 Columns 30/70* for the layout.

5. Click *Add Page*.

You have now added a new page to *The Lunar Resort* site. That site will appear 
in the navigation, and you can add applications and content to the page.

## Creating the About Page

Next you'll create a 3 column layout page for *About Us*.

1. Back in the main menu, go to *Navigation* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2. Click on the menu button for *Public Pages* and select *Add Public Page*.

3. Enter "About Us" for the *Name*.

4. Select *3 Columns* for the layout.

5. Click *Add Page*.

## Checking your pages

Your nav bar will contain the two new pages that you've created. Currently 
there is no content on the pages, but after you're done creating the pages and 
layouts that you need for your site, you'll add applications and content.
