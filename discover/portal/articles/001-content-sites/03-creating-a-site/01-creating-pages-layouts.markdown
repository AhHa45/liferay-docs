# Creating Pages with Layouts

The Welcome page has the simplest possible layout - 1 Column.
Everything that you add to the page takes up the full width of the page and 
stacks vertically. If you add a new application to the page, it will be placed 
above or below the current content. Other layouts allow you to add items side by
side, or in some cases, have multiple row types, with some some sections having 
only one column, while others have multiple.

## Creating the Activities Page

1. Open the main menu, and go to *Navigation* for *The Lunar Resort*.

2. Click on the menu button for *Public Pages* and select *Add Public Page*.

You are now on the page creation form. You can set the page name, choose a 
template or layout, and set a number of other options.

3. Enter "Activities" for the *Name*.

4. Select *2 Columns 30/70* for the layout.
