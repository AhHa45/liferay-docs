# Application Display Templates

For the final piece of the site that you'll construct with Liferay's Web
Experience Management system, you need to create a more engaging front page
graphic. To do this, you'll use multiple images and an Application Display 
Template (ADT) to display them as a carousel.

ADTs are essentially the same as Web Content Template, but rather than have the 
variables and fields defined by a structure, they're defined by the application 
that you're applying the template to.

## ADTs and Scope

Liferay comes bundled with several default ADTs which exist at the 
*Global* scope. Scope, in Liferay simply means where content can be used or 
viewed. All of the content that you have created so far has been in the scope 
of The Lunar Resort site. If you were to create a second site on the same 
Liferay server, you would not be able to access content that you created for
The Lunar Resort in the second site. The Global scope exists for things that
need to be available to all of the sites.

To create your own ADT, switch to the Global scope and create it there alongside
all of the system default ADTs.
