# Displaying Basic Content

The basic hierarchy for displaying content in Liferay goes something like this: 

* All content exists within a site (like The Lunar Resort).

* All pages also exist within a site (like the Welcome page for the Lunar 
    Resort).

* You can display content from a site on a page in that same site.

* All content is displayed inside of an application like the Web Content Display
    or Asset Publisher.
    
You have a site. You have a page. You have content. Let's add that content to 
that page.

1. Click on *The Lunar Resort* in the top left corner of the screen to go back 
    to the *Welcome* page.
    
2. Open the *Add* menu. *Content* will be selected.

3. Click and drag *Lunar Resort Welcome* onto the page above the *Hello World*
    portlet.
    
Behind the scenes, Liferay placed your content inside of a Web Content Display
application, and added that to the page to display your content. You could have also added a Web Content Display application to the page yourself and configured it to display this content.
