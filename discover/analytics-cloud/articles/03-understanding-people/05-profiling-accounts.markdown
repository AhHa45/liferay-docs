# Profiling Accounts

If you have a Salesforce data source, Analytics Cloud can import and analyze 
Salesforce account data. By combining Salesforce account data with data from 
other sources, Analytics Cloud presents a holistic view of the account and those 
in it. 

To view account analytics, select *Accounts* from the left navigation panel. The 
accounts are displayed in a searchable table that lists the following data for 
each account: 

-   Account Type
-   Individuals
-   Total Activities
-   30-Day Engagement Score

Click an account to view its information, which is organized into these tabs: 

-   Overview
-   Activities
-   Interests
-   Segments
-   Individuals
-   Details

The sections that follow describe each. 

## Overview 

The Overview tab presents a summary of the account's data. It displays summaries
of the following account data: 

-   Activities
-   Firmographics
-   Contact information
-   Individuals
-   Interest topics
-   Segments 

If more information is available for each, you can access it via its link. For 
example, a *View All Activities* link is at the bottom of the Account Activities 
pane. Click this link to view the Activities tab, which shows much more detailed 
information about activities.
