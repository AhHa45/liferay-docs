# Customer Insights [](id=customer-insights)

Learning who's highly involved with your site tells you who to target for new
sales. Finding out topics they're interested in helps you relate your products
and services to them. Analytics Cloud's Interests and Engagement insights
empower you with rich, easy-to-understand visuals that provide this information. 

## Interests [](id=interests)

As an Individual interacts with the pages and assets, Analytics Cloud notes the
topics they contain. The more an Individual visits pages and assets that contain
a topic, the higher the topic's ranking is for that Individual's Segments. 

![Figure 1: Clicking on an Interest topic for a Segment (or Individual) shows a histogram of the Segment's interaction with pages and assets mentioning the topic. In this figure, *Intranets* is the selected topic. Clicking on a histogram point shows the pages and assets viewed during that time period.](../../images/interests-insight.png)

For example, say your site has pages that mention these topics:

- Clothing
- Sports

If an Individual named Michael frequents these pages, the Interest ranking for
the *clothing* and *sports* topics is high. Here are a couple of different ways
you could use this information:

- If you sell sports apparel, you could prepare a campaign for selling sports 
  apparel to Michael.

- If you don't sell sports apparel, you could use the Interest data to convince 
  sports apparel vendors to advertise on your site.

Either way, the Interests insight helps generate new business. The Interests
insight tells you the most common topics mentioned by the pages and assets
customers visit most. 

## Engagement [](id=engagement)

The Engagement score generated for Individuals and Segments indicates their
involvement with your company and its sites. High Engagement scores serve as
leads to new customers and new business.

The Engagement score is calculated based on the following scores, during
people's sessions on your sites.

- *Interaction Score:* 

    - Length of time the Individual stays on each page.
    - Scroll depth and scroll speed.

- *Variety Score:* Number of distinct pages the Individual visits.

- *Loyalty Score:* Number of days before an Individual returns to the site.

- *Purpose Score:* Number of converted call actions (performed actions) for 
  pages and assets that have call actions, such as a form submit action or other
  call action.

The Overview profile tab for each Individual and Segment contains an Engagement
histogram. 

1. Select the *Moving Avg. Engagement* score in the main area to show it.

2. Select a chart point, shows the average Engagement score for that time
   period.

If you're viewing Engagement for a Segment, the bottom part of the page lists
the Individuals in descending order by Engagement score. Once again, Segments
are your fast track to learning about customers. 

In conclusion, Engagement scores give you an overall idea of customer
involvement and interest in your brand, so you can decide where to focus your attention.
