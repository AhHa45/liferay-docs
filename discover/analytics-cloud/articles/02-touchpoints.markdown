# Touchpoints: Engaging People

Touchpoints are a key concept in Analytics Cloud. If you don't know what touchpoints are,
read the Analytics Cloud [introductory documentation](LINK). In summary, Touchpoints are:

- Pages on a website.
- Imported during the initial Analytics Cloud setup.
- Queried on a schedule.
- Reported on in Analytics Cloud with the data reports shown in this article.

Readers of this article have an understanding of what Analytics Cloud is and want to
understand where Touchpoint data exists, what metrics it includes, and how to
interpret the data and configure its views for easiest consumption by end users.

## Finding Touchpoint Data

To view Touchpoint data directly:

1.  Find the Engagement section of the menu.

2. Click *Touchpoints*.

SCREENSHOT

To view the Touchpoint data for a particular Individual or Segment:

1.  Navigate to the Individuals or Segments screen in the People section of the
    menu.

2. The Overview tab contains analytics on the Individual's (or Segment's)
   interaction with Touchpoints.

SCREENSHOT

The table of Touchpoints provides two ways to visualize Touchpoints: 

Order Touchpoints by ascending or descending order based on any one of these
metrics:

- Engagement score
- Visitors
- Views
- Time on Page

SCREENSHOT

In addition to ordering the Touchpoints, filter them by entering search terms.
There's a prominent search bar at the top of the Touchpoints table. Run a basic
search and see the matching Touchpoints returned.

SCREENSHOT

Once you have some returned results, perhaps being ordered by one of the
available metrics in descending order, turn your attention to the Time Period
selector next to the search bar. It recalculates the result based on the time
period selected. If you go from a shorter time period to longer, you'll
naturally see more results. In addition, metrics are recalculated. Take
Views as an example to see how this works:

If the example project was for Liferay's own sites, searching for *symposium*
and ordering the results in descending order would give us a healthy sample.
However, you must specify the time period for which you'd like to view the
metrics. The default is 30 days, but this is configurable. The following values
are supported:

- Last 24 hours
- Yesterday
- Last 7 days
- Last 28 days
- Last 30 days (default)
- Last 90 days

Take 90 days for our example search for *symposium*. Now all Touchpoints
containing the word *symposium* are returned, in descending order of views *in
the last 90 days*.

Viewing the list of Touchpoints with their overview data is great, but what if
you want to dive into each metric?
