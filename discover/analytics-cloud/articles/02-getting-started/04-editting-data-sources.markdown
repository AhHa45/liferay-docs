# Editing Data Sources [](id=editing-data-sources)

You might need to modify your data sources from time to time. 

To see your data sources:

1. Select *Settings* in the navigation panel.

2. Click on *Data Sources*.

The Data Sources page appears and lists all existing data sources.

You can page through the data source listing or use *Search* to find one that matches a keyword. Once you've found the data source, click on it to edit it. Hereâ€™s what you can modify:

- Name of the data source
- Contact mapping
- Enable/disable Contact or Analytics sync

After you've imported contact and behavior data, you can start learning more
about your customers. The *Understanding People* articles are all about that.
