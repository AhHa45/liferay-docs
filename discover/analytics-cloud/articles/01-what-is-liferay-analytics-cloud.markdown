# What is Liferay Analytics Cloud?

Your company interacts with lots of people, including existing and prospective
customers. On your websites they browse products and services, ask questions,
leave feedback, etc. Presenting relevant, interesting website content motivates
people to do business with you. Knowing your customers well and understanding
how they interact with existing digital content can help you improve their
experience. Liferay Analytics Cloud generates powerful, intuitive charts that
deepen your knowledge of people and their online behavior so you can create
terrific user experiences that drive business. 

It all starts with understanding people.

## Understanding People 

Existing and prospective customers interact with your company in person, on your
websites, and via email and messaging. On Liferay Digital Enterprise (DE)
websites, people are registered users or visitors. Liferay Analytics Cloud
(Analytics Cloud) integrates contacts from your Liferay DE instances and CSV
files into a single view. Analytics Cloud merges contact data into rich profiles
of *Individuals*---unique contacts (people). Analytics Cloud lets you name
contact fields your way, making them most useful to you and your company.

Analytics Cloud lets you aggregate Individuals into *Segments*. Segments are
aggregates of Individuals that have common characteristics. You can create
Segments dynamically based on criteria or statically (comprising hand selected
Individuals). You can use industry, for example, as a criteria. Industry Segment
Analytics shows industries engaging with you most and identifies your content
that interests them. 

Contact profiles are a big part of Analytics Cloud, but analytics about people's
interaction with your website pages and assets is a bigger part. This type of
analytics (called Touchpoint Analytics) helps you determine content
effectiveness in achieving your business goals. 

## Touchpoint Interaction

*Touchpoints* are the locations (pages) where people interact with content. Here
are some of the Touchpoint Analytics: 

-   Visitor count: the number of users (guest and signed in) visiting a 
    Touchpoint
-   Session length: amount of time people are spending on a channel (e.g., 
    Liferay DE instance). 
-   Number of sessions: number of different people at a Touchpoint
-   Time on page: amount of time people are spending at a Touchpoint
-   Bounce rate: percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate 
    away from the site after viewing only one Touchpoint

*Assets* are specific types of content entities on Touchpoints. Traditional web 
analytics are based on static websites---everyone sees the same page content. By
additionally providing analytics on content articles, Analytics Cloud helps you
determine the effectiveness of those articles. Asset Analytics also provides
insight into people's interaction with dynamic personalized content. It
generates charts on target audiences engage the content.

Liferay Analytics Cloud release 1.0 supports these Asset types from Liferay
Digital Enterprise:

- Blogs
- Documents and Media
- Forms

Regarding user behavior with a form, for example, Analytics Cloud shows the
number of views and submissions, the percentage of users abandoning the form,
and the form's average completion time. A line graph shows the number of views
over time.

As you view Touchpoint and Asset Analytics you can discern whether an action is
positive or negative. Here are some examples. 

Positive:

- staying active in sessions
- frequent sign in
- submitting a form 
- giving an article five stars

Negative:

- signing out shortly after signing in
- passing by key strategic content
- abandoning a form
- letting a session timeout

The analytics help you determine better ways to relate to people and earn their
business. For example, if the majority of people in a target industry Segment
reactive positively to content that describes a new service you're selling, the
Segment might be interested in similar services. 

Analytics Cloud uncovers issues too. If lots of people abandon a form after
entering data leading up to a particular field, for example, the field might be
problematic. If the field's label is ambiguous, make it clear. If filling in the
field is cumbersome, make it multiple choice. If the field is more trouble than
its worth, remove it. The point is Analytics Cloud uncovers trouble spots for
you to address. Identifying and resolving issues makes your websites better and
helps you achieve business goals. 

Learning how people get to pages and Assets is also useful.

## Path Analytics

People get to content in different ways (paths):

- Site navigation
- Search within the site
- Google search
- Links inside other pages
- Links within Assets

If you expect a particular navigation sequence to be popular for locating a
particular Touchpoint (page), for example, check for it in the Touchpoint's Path
Analytics. If links inside a particular user's blog posts draw users to target
content, have that user incorporate more key content links in his blog posts. 

Path Analytics includes analytics on device types and browser types that render
your site content. Knowing the device types and browser types can help you
determine which ones to test more and optimize user experiences on.
