# Publishing A/B Test Variants

[TOC levels=1-4]

Once the A/B test has concluded and Analytics Cloud has computed the test
results, the status for the test displays as *Winner Declared* (if a winning
Variant was found) or *No Winner* in the A/B Test sidebar panel. You're
also alerted to the result via a notification, which you can view from the User
Menu.

| **Note:** When the required confidence level is not met during the time
| duration, there is no winning Variant.

Click the *Publish Winner as Experience* button to publish your winning Variant
Experience. Once you publish a Variant, the A/B test's status is *Completed* and
the test is finished.

In cases where you'd like to publish an alternative Variant that was not
declared a winner, select the Variant from the A/B Test panel and click
*Publish*.

Your Control Variant is now overwritten with the new Variant and available to
all users who visit the Page.

Awesome! You successfully ran an A/B test and published the Variant that is
most effective for your Site's users.
