# A/B Testing

[TOC levels=1-4]

| **Note:** A/B Testing is available for Liferay DXP 7.2 SP1+.

One of the most important objectives for any team is providing the right
experience for their audience. To help shape your idea of the customers' needs,
you should periodically test your site's effectiveness by displaying a different
UX and messaging scheme. This lets you form a hypothesis about your audience and
test it to confirm or disprove it. When doing this, you should be cautious about
how much your process changes impact customers' current workflow on your site.
You should provide a solution that easily fits into their existing workflow
while adding as little overhead as possible.

This can be done using *A/B Testing*. This lets you maintain a page's current UX
and messaging, but provide alternative page variants for a select group of
visitors. Then the current page and page variant(s) are tested based on
algorithms to determine which pages perform better for a given goal (e.g.,
bounce rate, clicks, etc.).

For example, consider a Marketing team for a bank provides a Content Page
advertising their new credit card. The page has been published for a few weeks,
but they think a redesign could help promote the new credit card better. With
A/B Testing, they can create a new page variant and display both pages at random
to visitors. Then they can analyze the clickthrough rate for the two pages and
find which page is more effective. If the page variant is more effective than
the original page, they can publish it and remove the old page.
